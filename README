Public domain.  Originally written 2005 by Karl Berry.

For a high-level overview of building TeX Live, see
http://tug.org/texlive/build.html.  In brief:

To configure and make the source tree, run ./Build.
To build (mostly) without optimization, run ./Build --debug.
To make without configuring, run TL_CONFIGURE=true ./Build.
Email tlbuild@tug.org if problems.

(Nearly everything the Build script does can be overridden via
environment variables; just take a look to see the names.)

Many more details about the TL build system, such as configuring to work
on a single program, adding new programs or libraries, recompiling after
fixing problems, etc., are in the doc/tlbuild* document and the sibling
README* files here (which are generated from that document).


Build information for some of the platforms.

i386-linux: gcc 4.9.2, Linux 2.6.18-* (CentOS 5.10, tug.org:~karl/bin/mybuild)
  Except for dvisvgm, where we must use the system compiler (gcc 4.1.2,
  Red Hat 4.1.2-54) or libgs.so crashes trying to use gcc 4.8.2's
  libstdc++.  On the other hand, the system compiler has an optimization
  bug that causes lcdf-typetools's tfm.test to fail, so it can't be used
  for everything.  Sigh.
        
x86_64-linux: gcc 4.8.2, libc 2.3.6, Linux 2.6.28.6
  
amd64-netbsd:
  gcc version 4.5.3 (NetBSD nb2 20110806)
  NetBSD/amd64 6.1.3
  TL_MAKE=gmake LDFLAGS='-L/usr/X11R7/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/X11R7/lib' ./Build
  
i386-openbsd, amd64-openbsd:
  e.g., see CONFIGURE_ARGS in the Makefile in
  http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/print/texlive/base/

i386-solaris, x86_64-solaris: Solaris 10.  See doc/README.solaris.

i386-cygwin, x86_64-cygwin: gcc-4.8.2, cygwin-1.7.29.
  ./Build (with --enable-xindy for i386).

powerpc-linux (Debian Squeeze):
  Linux homer 2.6.32-5-powerpc64 #1 SMP Tue Mar 8 02:01:42 UTC 2011
  ppc64 Debian GNU/Linux 6.0
  (only the kernel is 64bit, the entire userland is 32bit)

sparc-solaris: Solaris 10, gcc.  See doc/README.solaris.

universal-darwin, x86_64-darwin: a menagerie of versions.
  See Master/source/mactexdoc.tar.xz.
