This README.md file exists for people browsing on github.

The TeX-Live project on github (https://github.com/TeX-Live) is a mirror
of the upstream Subversion repository (https://tug.org/texlive/svn). We
use it primarily for automatic building of the sources on several platforms.

We prefer using mailing lists to github: tex-live@tug.org for general
bugs and discussion, tex-k@tug.org for bugs and patches for the compiled
programs, and so on. List of TL lists: https://tug.org/texlive/lists.html.

However, if you prefer to open issues or submit PRs on github, that's
ok. We will see them and will reply as soon as we can.

One common problem: Package bug reports should go to the package
maintainer, however they wish to receive reports, not to any general
TeX Live list. TL redistributes what is uploaded to CTAN without changes.

For information about the source tree here, see the ./README file here,
not this README.md.
