	Building zlib-1.3.1 as part of the TL tree
	==========================================

This directory libs/zlib/ uses a proxy Makefile.am to build the zlib library
'libz' from the unmodified(*) source tree in libs/zlib/zlib-src/, bypassing
the original build system.

As far as applicable, the tests in libs/zlib/zlib-src/configure have been
translated into equivalent test in libs/zlib/configure.ac.

-----------------------------

(*) almost unmodified,  the file zconf.h has been removed!
