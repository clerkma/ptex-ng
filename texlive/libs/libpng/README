	Building libpng-1.6.43 as part of the TL tree
	=============================================

This directory libs/libpng/ uses a proxy Makefile.am to build the libpng library
from the unmodified (*) source tree in libs/libpng/libpng-src/, bypassing
the original build system.

(*) The directory TLpatches contains patches (if any) applied to
the original source tree.

As far as applicable, the tests in libs/libpng-src/configure.ac have been
copied to libs/libpng/configure.ac.
