.TH PAPERSIZE 5
.SH NAME
.B papersize
\- specify preferred paper size
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B @PAPERCONF@
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B papersize
file is used to specify the preferred paper size to use by available
commands and programs generating documents.
.PP
The format of this file is extremely simple: whitespace and anything
starting with `#' is ignored, and the name of the paper is the first
string found; the case in the name of the paper does not import (see
.B CAVEATS
section however).
.SH "PAPER NAMES"
The following names are commonly understood by programs:
.B a3\fP,\fB a4\fP,\fB a5\fP,
.B b5\fP,\fB letter\fP,\fB legal\fP,\fB executive\fP,\fB note\fP
and
.BR 11x17 .
.PP
Additional paper names that one may encounter are:
.B a0\fP,\fB a1\fP,\fB a2\fP,\fB a6\fP,\fB a7\fP,\fB a8\fP,\fB a9\fP,\fB a10\fP,
.B b0\fP,\fB b1\fP,\fB b2\fP,\fB b3\fP,\fB b4\fP,\fB tabloid\fP,
.B statement\fP,\fB note\fP,
.B halfletter\fP,\fB halfexecutive\fP,\fB folio\fP,\fB quarto\fP,\fB ledger\fP,
.B archA\fP,\fB archB\fP,\fB archC\fP,\fB archD\fP,\fB archE\fP,\fB flsa\fP,
.B flse\fP,\fB csheet\fP,\fB dsheet\fP,\fB esheet\fP
and       
.BR 10x14 .
.PP
The value of the
.B papersize
file can be overrideen by
looking in order at the
.B @PAPERSIZEVAR@
environment variable, then at the contents of the file specified by the
.B @PAPERCONFVAR@
environment variable.  If the
.B papersize
file does not exist, programs using the paper library default to using
.B letter
as a fall-back value
.SH CAVEATS
This manual page documents the format of the
.B papersize
file that is read by the
.B libpaper
library.
Some programs that read this file do not yet use the library and may have
trouble ignoring whitespace and comments in the file; they may also
require that the paper names use a specific capitalization.
