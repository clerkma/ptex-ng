Changes between MPFI version 1.5.3 and 1.5.4
* MPFI now requires MPFR 3.0 or higher
* mp_exp_t replaced by mpfr_exp_t, mp_prec_t replaced by mpfr_prec_t, mp_rnd_t replaced by mpfr_rnd_t
  GMP_RNDx replaced by MPFR_RNDx
* incorporation of "new" functionalities offered by MPFR since MPFR version 2.4.2:

Changes between MPFI version 1.5.2 and 1.5.3
* compatible with MPFR version 4.0.0
* minor warnings removed

Changes between MPFI version 1.5 and 1.5.2
* allow compilation as a DLL with Cygwin and Mingw on windows platforms
 (reported by Jean-Pierre Flori)
* fix documentation of comparison functions (reported by Keith BRIGGS)
* fix bug in mpfi_sub_fr (reported by Takayuki YAMAGUCHI)
* now require at least GMP version 4.1.0 and MPFR version 2.4.2
* new symbols MPFI_VERSION_MAJOR, MPFI_VERSION_MINOR, MPFI_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL,
  and MPFI_VERSION_STRING in mpfi.h
* detect availability of mpfr_z_sub, mpfr_z_div, and mpfr_q_sub and use a
  custom implementation for the ones not provided by MPFR (mpfr_z_sub appeared
  in MPFR 3.1.0, the other ones are used in tests only)
* code cleanup (unused variables)
* tadd_q does no more check overflow by default (required too much memory)
* sign of zeros choice documented

Changes between MPFI version 1.4 and 1.5

* new functions : Catalan's constant, cubic root, secant, cosecant, cotangent
  and hyperbolic counterparts, atan2, hypot, get_version, urandom
* new test suite (99.7% LOC)
* can now be compiled outside the source directory
* change configure options to be consistent with the ones in MPFR and MPC:
  --with-gmp-dir=DIR changed to --with-gmp=DIR
  --with-gmp-libpath=DIR changed to --with-gmp-lib=DIR
  --with-gmp-incpath=DIR changed to --with-gmp-include=DIR
  --with-mpfr-dir=DIR changed to --with-mpfr=DIR
  --with-mpfr-libpath=DIR changed to --with-mpfr-lib=DIR
  --with-mpfr-incpath=DIR changed to --with-mpfr-include=DIR
* now require at least GMP version 4.1.0 and MPFR version 2.4.0
* each function is in its own file (compile_time *= 8;)
* limitation to 1000 characters in mpfi_set_str removed.
* fix documentation for functions mpfi_blow, mpfi_is_inside at least.
* fix bug in mpfi_ui_sub when reusing a variable (bug reported by
  Sisyphus 2010-01-19).
* fix bug in mpfi_blow: the result could be underestimated when the factor was
  small compared to 1.
* fix double rounding error in basic arithmetic functions with a non-interval
  parameter (like mpfi_add_si).
* the following functions now return 0 (false) if one or more of their
  operands is NaN or has a NaN as an endpoint : mpfi_is_inside,
  mpfi_is_inside_d, mpfi_is_inside_ui, mpfi_is_inside_si, mpfi_is_inside_z,
  mpfi_is_inside_q, mpfi_is_inside_fr, mpfi_is_pos, mpfi_is_strictly_pos,
  mpfi_is_nonneg, mpfi_is_neg, mpfi_is_strictly_neg, mpfi_is_nonpos,
  mpfi_inf_p, mpfi_bounded_p

Changes between MPFI 1.3.4-RC3 and 1.4

* bugfixes for trigonometric functions
* add compilation for a shared library

Changes between MPFI version 1.1 and 1.3.4-RC3

* mainly, keep on par with new developments in MPFR during these years

Changes between MPFI version 1.0 and 1.1

* GNU autoconf/automake standards
* mpfi-impl.h (non exported internal macros)
