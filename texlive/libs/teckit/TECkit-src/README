This is TECkit, a library for encoding conversion, usable through standalone
tools or by linking with other software packages.

See the Documentation folder for information on the TECkit mapping language
and conversion tool usage notes.

The TECkit libraries have been updated to support the Unicode 15.0.0 character
repertoire.

Starting with TECkit version 2.5.7 there are several changes with the Windows
builds. First, a 64-bit build has been added to the already existing 32-bit
build. Second, the runtime files have changed. The file libwinpthread-1.dll
is no longer needed. The file libstdc++-6.dll needs to match the build
(32 or 64 bit) of the rest of the code. The 32-bit build needs
libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll, while the 64-bit build needs libgcc_s_seh-1.dll.
