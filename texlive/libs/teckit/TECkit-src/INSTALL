INSTALL

Note: If you checked out teckit from a VCS, or for any other reason don't have
a file called "configure", you will need to initialize the directory using
GNU autotools. Instructions for this are given further down.

For typical Unix-like systems:

	./configure
	make
	[sudo] make install

Installs tools into /usr/local/lib, with libraries and header files in
/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include respectively.

Typical configure options such as --prefix should work, though little testing
has been done.

The tools installed are:
	teckit_compile
		compiler to create binary mapping tables (.tec) from text files (.map)
	txtconv
		simple tool to apply a mapping to a plain-text file
	sfconv
		tool to apply mappings to a Standard Format file, as specified by
		a control file

BUILDING for WINDOWS

You will need to install MinGW.

On Mac or Linux, you can use the package system as follows:

	gcc-mingw32 (Debian/Ubuntu)
	i386-mingw32-gcc (MacPorts)

You may also need some other packages on Mac, such as updated autotools.

On Windows, install MinGW+MSys. Probably the easiest way to do this is to
download and run mingw-get-inst. Check the options for C++ and MSYS Basic.
Once installed, you can open a Unix-like shell by running MinGW > MinGW Shell
from the All Programs menu. File and directory names use forward slashes in MSys,
and C:\ is represented as /c

Using the cd command, navigate to the place where you checked out or unzipped
the teckit sources. Note that if there are spaces in any of the parent directory
names you may experience difficulty building. If so, move the source directory
to a location that doesn't involve spaces (eg C:\src\teckit).

If necessary, follow the GNU AUTOTOOLS instructions below, then run:

	./build-windows-binaries.sh

This will create executables and DLLs in teckit-windows-bin. Documentation,
header files, sample tools, etc. can be added and the result zipped to produce
a release.

BUILDING a LINUX PACKAGE

Run the following script:

	./build-linux-package.sh

The results will be in the teckit-linux subdirectory.

To build just a source package that can be passed to an external package builder
(such as `pbuilder`) add `-S` to the command line. Other `debuild` options can
be given as well.

BUILDING a MAC PACKAGE

Run the following script:

	./build-mac-binaries.sh

This will create files in the teckit-mac subdirectory. To make the package itself:

	cd mac-installer
	./create-pkg.sh

The result will be a file called TECkit.dmg containing a single .pkg file.

GNU AUTOTOOLS

If you don't have a file called "configure" in the top-level teckit source
directory, you will need to initialize the directory using GNU autotools.

On Windows, install the autotools by running:

	mingw-get install mingw32-autotools

On Mac or Linux, use the package system (MacPorts on Mac).

Then, on all platforms, run:

	./autogen.sh

in the teckit source directory. This normally needs to be done only once, but
if you update your directory from the VCS you may need to run it again.
