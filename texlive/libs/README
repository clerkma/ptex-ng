Public domain.  Originally created by Karl Berry, 2005.

Libraries we compile for TeX Live.

All libraries use the original source tree with all modifications
maintained as patches and use a proxy build system, either
bypassing or using the original one.

See also comments in ../texk/README.

cairo 1.16.0 - no longer checked
  https://cairographics.org/releases/
  There are later releases than this, but they removed autotools support.
  Since cairo is only used by MetaPost (for png output), and 1.16.0
  seems fine for that, not taking the time and trouble to update.
