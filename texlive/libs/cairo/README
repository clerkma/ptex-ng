	Building cairo-1.16.0 as part of the TL tree
	============================================

This directory libs/cairo/ uses a proxy Makefile.am to build the cairo
library 'libcairo' from the unmodified source tree in
libs/cairo/cairo-src/, bypassing the original build system.

As far as applicable, the tests in libs/cairo/cairo-src/configure have
been translated into equivalent test in libs/cairo/configure.ac.
