**
**  DESCRIPTION
**
**      A 32-bit implementation of BibTeX v0.99c for MS-DOS, OS/2 2.x, 
**      Unix and VMS.  This C language implementation is based on the 
**      original WEB source but it has been enhanced to support 8-bit input
**      characters and a very large processing capacity.
**
**      For documentation describing how to use and build this program, 
**      see the 00README.TXT file that accompanies this distribution.

**  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
**      
**      The original BIBTEX was written by Oren Patashnik using Donald 
**      Knuth's WEB system.  This format produces a PASCAL program for 
**      execution and a TeX documented version of the source code. This 
**      program is a (hand) translation of the WEB source into C.
