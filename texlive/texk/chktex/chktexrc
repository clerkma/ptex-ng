## chktexrc file format
#
# The chktexrc file is essentially a bunch of variable assignments.
# There are two types of variables, those that take single items and
# those that take lists.
#
# In turn, there are two types of lists, case-sensitive and case-insensitive.
# Case-sensitive lists are delimited by `{' and `}'
# while case-insensitive are delimited by `[' and `]'.
# Only some variables support case insensitive lists, since in many
# cases it doesn't make sense and would be unnecessarily slow.  Those
# variables that *do* support case-insensitive lists will be marked as
# such throughout the file.
#
# Variables can be set with or without an equals sign.  If included, the
# `=' causes the variable to be overwritten.  This is the only thing
# that makes sense for variables taking a single item and so we always
# include it in that case.  For list variables, omitting the equals
# sign will cause the items in the list to be appended instead of
# overwriting the entire list.
#
# Below are all the ways in which a variable can be set.  Note that lists
# can span lines, though this is not shown here for brevity.
#
#
# VariableName = item
# # Overwrites
# VariableName = { Item1 Item2 ... }
# VariableName = [ item1 item2 ... ]
# VariableName = { Item1 Item2 ... } [ item item ... ]
# VariableName = [ item1 item2 ... ] { Item Item ... }
# # Appends
# VariableName { Item3 Item4 ... }
# VariableName [ item3 item4 ... ]
# VariableName { Item3 Item4 ... } [ item item ... ]
# VariableName [ item3 item4 ... ] { Item Item ... }
#
#
# Comments begin with `#', and continue for the end of the line.
# Blank lines plus leading and trailing spaces are ignored.
# Items are separated by spaces.
# Newlines are considered spaces, but can't be escaped.
# You can use double quotes `"' to surround an item with spaces, or you can
# escape spaces as described later.
#
# Detection of tokens like `}' are somewhat context sensitive---they
# have to be preceded by a space (or newline).  This allows them to be
# part of an item without escaping.  Since some variables require such
# characters, this generally makes life easier.
#
# To include characters that might otherwise interfere, escape
# sequences are provided.  They are similar to those in C, but use
# `!' instead of `\' for obvious reasons.
# The entire list is below.
#
#   Sequence    Resulting character 
#   `! '        Space 
#   `!"'        `"' 
#   `!#'        `#' 
#   `!!'        `!' 
#   `!{'        `{' 
#   `!}'        `}' 
#   `!['        `[' 
#   `!]'        `]' 
#   `!='        `=' 
#   `!b'        Backspace 
#   `!n'        New line 
#   `!r'        Carriage return 
#   `!t'        Tab 
#   `!f'        Form feed 
#   `!xNN'      NN must be a hexadecimal number (00 - ff),
#                  both characters must be included. 
#   `!dNNN'     NNN must be a decimal number (000 - 255), all
#                  three characters must be included.
#                  Unspecified results if NNN > 377. 
#   `!NNN'      NNN must be a octal number (000 - 377), all
#                  three characters must be included.
#                  Unspecified results if NNN > 377.

## Available Settings
#
# All available settings follow.
#

## QuoteStyle
#
# The type of quote-style you are using.  There are currently two
# styles:
#
#  Traditional:
#      "An example," he said, "would be great."
#
#  Logical:
#      "An example", he said, "would be great".
#
QuoteStyle = Logical


## TabSize
#
# The width of a tab.  This is used for formatting the error message.
# Only positive integers are allowed.
#
TabSize = 8


## CmdSpaceStyle
#
# How to treat a command is followed by punctuation.  In all cases the
# warnings are also governed by the main warning settings, namely
# warnings 12 and 13 about interword and intersentence spacings.
#
# If set to Ignore, then it won't print any warnings when punctuation
# follows a command.
#
#
# If CmdSpaceStyle is set to InterWord, then it will print warnings
# when interword spacing should (potentially) be used.  For example,
# without a command the following will trigger warning 12
#
#     `I've seen a UFOs, etc. in my life.'
#
# And if set to InterWord, so will
#
#     `I've seen a UFOs, \etc. in my life.'
#
#
# If set to InterSentence, then it will print warnings when
# intersentence spacing should (potentially) be used.  For example,
# without a command the following will trigger warning 13
#
#     `I've seen an UFO! Right over there!'
#
# And if set to InterSentence, so will
#
#     `I've seen an \UFO! Right over there!'
#
#
# Setting CmdSpaceStyle to Both will cause warnings to be printed in
# both cases.
#
CmdSpaceStyle = Ignore


## CmdLine
#
# Default command-line options.  For instance, you might like to put
# `-v2' here.
#
CmdLine
{
}


## UserWarn
#
# Arbitrary strings to warn about.  You can put here to help you find
# your own little foibles.  See also UserWarnRegex.
#
# These patterns will be searched for throughout the text; regardless
# of whether they appear as normal text, commands, in math mode, etc.
# They are *not* found in comments.
#
# Suppose you define a special command like this:
#    \def\unknown{\large\bf??}
# which you use whenever you don't have some information at the time
# of writing.  Thus, it makes sense to warn on it, and this is a
# convenient way to do so.
#
UserWarn
{
    \unknown
    # One should write \chktex or Chk\TeX - never ChkTeX.
    ChkTeX
}
[ # You may put case-insensitive patterns here.
]


## UserWarnRegex
#
# A more sophisticated version of UserWarn using regular
# expressions.  Use of these will be automatically disabled if ChkTeX
# was built without regular expression support.  Because ChkTeX can be
# with support for either POSIX or PCRE flavors of regular expression,
# some of the following will not apply in all cases.  An expression
# can be defined only when PCRE is enabled by prepending the
# expression with `PCRE:' and similarly with `POSIX:'.
#
# These patterns will be searched for, no matter whether they appear
# as normal text, commands, or arguments.  However, they will *not*
# match in verbatim environments (see VerbEnvir).
#
# Remember that you have to escape (with a `!') the characters
# `"#!=', as well as spaces and `{}[]' if they are
# proceeded by a space.
#
# When using PCRE regular expressions, you can use `(?i)' to make
# the expression case insensitive.  See the man pages (man pcresyntax)
# or the nicely formatted http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html for
# documentation on the regular expression syntax.  Note, however, that
# some the features of perl regular expression are not available such
# as running code (callouts), and replacing.
#
# An initial PCRE-style comment `(?# ... )' can be used
# to change what is displayed, thereby reminding yourself how to fix
# the problem.  This works even for POSIX expressions.

## TeXInputs
#
# A list of paths where ChkTeX should look for files it `\input's.
# By default, the current directory is searched (not recursively, use
# `//' for that, see below).
#
# A `//' postfix is supported:
# if you append a double path-separator we'll recursively search that
# directory's directories.  MS-DOS users must append `\\'
# instead, e.g. `C:\EMTEX\\'.  In order to search an
# entire directory tree, you must use *three* slashes,
# e.g. `c:\\\' or `///'.
#
TeXInputs
{
}


## OutFormat
#
# Output formats which can be selected from the command-line.  The
# `-v' option simply indexes into this list.  By default, entry number
# *two* in this list is chosen (counting from 0), and `-v'
# without any parameter selects entry number *three*.
#
# For explanation of the `%' format specifiers see the
# documentation of the `--format' command-line argument
# in the manual.
#
# Recall that to use `!' is the escape character, not `\'.

# Commands which should not trigger a warning if terminated by a space.

## HyphDash
#
# The number of dashes allowed between two alphabetic characters.
# Use 0 to always return an error.  For example:
#      foo-bar 
#      Use of two--dashes is not usually allowed in English. 
#      like this---see?
#
# For English, this will often be a single dash (hyphen).  If you like
# m-dashes with no spaces between them and the surrounding words, then
# it should include 3 as well.  There *are* cases when an n-dash
# is valid between two alphabetic characters.  See DashExcpt.
#
HyphDash { 1 3 }


## NumDash
#
# The number of dashes allowed between two numeric characters.
# Use 0 to always return an error.  This does *not* apply in
# math mode.  For example:
#      123--456 is a range 
#      $12-4$ \% okay because it's in math mode
#
# For English, this should be 2 because an n-dash is used to indicate
# a range of numbers and subtraction should be in math mode where this
# does not apply.
#
NumDash  { 2 }


## WordDash
#
# The number of dashes allowed between two space characters.
# Use 0 to always return an error.  For example:
#      not like - this,  
#      or like -- this.  
#      like this --- see?
#
WordDash { 3 }


## DashExcpt
#
# Exceptions to the dash rules above.  For example, an n-dash
# `--' between words is usually wrong, but in some cases it is correct,
# such as when naming a theorem.  The Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer
# conjecture is one example where the difference matters.  You can
# tell that Birch is one person and Swinnerton-Dyer is another based
# on the dashes used.
#
# Adding line suppressions for these is possible, but can quickly
# become tedious if a certain theorem is referenced often.  For this
# reason exceptions can be specified here.  They are case-sensitive.
#
# Unfortunately, there are no warnings if the dashes are surrounded by differing
# types of characters.  For example:
#      like this ---see? (space and alphabet)  
#      a--123            (number and alphabet) 
#      a.--b.            (other character, namely `.')
# Similarly, no warnings are issued if the hyphenation is correct,
# according to the other rules, for example:
#      Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer
#
DashExcpt
{
    Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer
}


## WipeArg
#
# Commands whose arguments aren't LaTeX code, and thus should be
# ignored.
#
# After the command, you may place arguments (separated from the
# command with a colon) that should be wiped.  Use `[]' for optional
# arguments, `{}' for required ones, and `*' if the command supports a
# star variant.  Some commands (e.g. `\cmidrule') use `()' to
# delimit an optional argument and so this syntax is supported as well.
#
# For instance, if you would like to wipe the `\newcommand' command,
# you would declare it as `\newcommand:*[][]{}' since it has a
# star variant, two optional arguments, and one required argument.
#
# These commands may be ``evaluated'' before they're wiped, so you will
# typically list file handling commands and similar here.

#
# The case-insensitive abbreviations are not fully case-insensitive.
# Rather, only the first character is case-insensitive, while the
# remaining characters are case-sensitive.
#
# To speed up the searching process somewhat, we require that these
# end in a `.' which should not be a problem in practice.

# character or any spacing characters either.  All of these characters
# have warnings associated with them and thus could cause spurious
# warnings to appear.
#
# The asterisk is also unsuitable, as some commands behave in another
# way if they are appended with an asterisk.  Which more or less
# leaves us with the pipe.
#
# Please note that this may also be a `string', which will be
# repeated until the proper length is reached.

## That's all for now - Happy LaTeXing!
