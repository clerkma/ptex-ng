Correspondence between DTL and DVI files.
-----------------------------------------

DTL variety sequences-6, version 0.6.0
--------------------------------------

Note:  `DTL' stands for `Device-Independent Text Language', and is an
ASCII text representation of a DVI file.

DTL Commands
------------

    variety <variety-name>  Specifies name of DTL file type.

Naturally, `variety' has no DVI equivalent.

The other DTL commands correspond one-to-one with DVI commands, but I
have used briefer names (except for `special') than those used in the
DVI standards document.

    DTL  :  DVI 

    (text)  :  series of set_char commands, for printable ASCII text
    \(   :  literal ASCII left parenthesis in (text)

    \"   :  literal ASCII double quote in (text)
    \XY  :  set_char for character with hexadecimal code XY,
            not in parentheses, but by itself for readability

    sr   :  set_rule
    p1, p2, p2, p3  :  put, with (1,2,3,4)-byte charcodes

    fn  :  fnt_num (set current font to font number in 0 to 63)
    f1, f2, f3, f4  :  fnt (set current font to (1,2,3,4)-byte font number)
    special  :  xxx (special commands with (1,2,3,4)-byte string length)
    fd  :  fnt_def (assign a number to a named font)
    pre  :  preamble
    post  :  post (begin postamble)
