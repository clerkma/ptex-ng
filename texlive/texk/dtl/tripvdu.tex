% This page has a paragraph illustrating most of the characters from the
% standard roman TeX text font.

\message{Standard paragraph.}
\rm
Our task is to create a paragraph illustrating what a typical piece of text
looks like in the standard \TeX\ font.  It should be stressed that not all
\TeX\ fonts can be used for typesetting text.  We need to show most of the
characters in this font---for instance, something like ``the quick brown fox
jumps over a lazy dog'' would use all the lower-case letters.  Hmmm \dots\
how about ``THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER 9876543210 LAZY DOGS'' to make
sure we show all the upper-case letters and digits?  Such a paragraph would
hardly be typical!  Then there's ligatures (try and fit in words like
fluffy, waffle, firefly, difficult) and examples of kerning (boxer, cooked,
vowel).  Not to mention the various accents and other special letters:
prot\'eg\'e, r\^ole, na\"\i ve, \AE sop's \OE vres en fran\c cais.
But how do we put all this stuff into a paragraph that makes sense!?
