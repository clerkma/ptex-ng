Modified -- June 4, 1986
Changed so that it automatically recognizes LaTeX source and ignores several
environment modes such as array.


Modified (Version 2.0) -- June 30, 1984
Now handles white space in sequences like "\begin { document }".  Detex is not
as easily confused by such things as display mode ends and begins that don't
match up.


Modified -- September 19, 1986
Added the "-e <environment-list>" option to ignore specified LaTeX
environments.


Modified -- June 30, 1987
Added the "-n" no-follow option, to allow detex to ignore \input and \include
commands.  Also changed the algorithm for locating the input files.  It now
interprets the "." more reasonably (i.e. it is not always the beginning of an
extension).


Modified -- December 15, 1988
Added handling of verbatim environment in LaTeX mode and added it to the list
of modes ignored by default.  Because of limitations with lex, it was
necessary to shorten the names of some of the existing start states before
adding a new one (ugh).


Modified -- January 3, 1988
Added ignore of \$ inside $$ (math) pair.


Modified (Version 2.2) -- June 25, 1990
Control sequences are no longer replaced by space, but just removed.  This
means accents no longer cause output words to be broken.  The "-c" option was
added to show the arguments of \cite, \ref, and \pageref macros.  This is
useful when using something like style on the output.


Modified (Version 2.3) -- September 7, 1990
Fixed the handling of Ctl mode a little better and added an exception
for \index on suggestions from kcb@hss.caltech.edu (KC Border).  Also
changed the value for DEFAULTINPUTS to coincide with a local change.


Modified -- February 10, 1991
Added -t option to force TeX mode even when seeing the "\begin{document}"
string in the input.


Modified -- February 23, 1991
Based on suggestions from pinard@iro.umontreal.ca (Francois Pinard), I
added support for the SysV string routines (-DUSG), added defines for
the flex lexical scanner (-DFLEX_SCANNER), changed NULL to '\0' when
using it as a character (his sys defined NULL as (void *)0), changed
the Makefile to use ${CC} instead of cc, and added comments about the
new compile time options.


Modified (Version 2.4) -- September 2, 1992
Corrected the way CITEBEGIN worked.  Due to serious braindeath I had
the condition wrong in the if test.  It should be (fLatex && !fCite).
This solves the problem a couple people reported with amstex style
\ref entries.

Added a preprocessing sed(1) command to replace all the long, easy to
read state names with short two letter state names (SA-S?) so that lex
won't overflow and I don't have to keep shortening the state names
every time I add one.  If a state is added, it must also be added to
states.sed (order is important) along with its unique S? replacement.

Added \pagestyle, \setcounter, and \verb handling from
K.Sattar@cs.exeter.ac.uk (Khalid Sattar).  Also allows invocation as
"delatex" to force LaTeX mode.

Applied patches from queinnec@cenatls.cena.dgac.fr (Philippe Queinnec)
to handle nested {}s in state <LaMacro2> (\bibitem, \cite, \index).

Added special ligature handling (\aa, \ae, \oe, \l, \o, \i, \j, \ss)
at the suggestion of gwp@dido.caltech.edu (G. W. Pigman II).

Cleaned up the comments on detex.h, added mathmatica to DEFAULTENV.


Modified (Version 2.5) -- January 28, 1993
Leading spaces in macros are no longer stripped.  This means
"foo\footnote{ bar}" comes out as "foo bar" instead of "foobar".

Fixed special ligature handling so it works in cases line {\ss} instead of
just when followed by a space.


Modified (Version 2.6) -- July 30, 1993
Added OS/2 port from hankedr@mail.auburn.edu (Darrel R Hankerson).

Added handling of leading and trailing ':' in TEXINPUTS per the latest
TeX as suggested by jnp@tfl.dk (J|rgen N|rgaard).

Changed the way the input path is constructed in SetInputPaths() so we
never try to modify a constant string.

Changed the way the the ignore environment list is contructed in
SetEnvIgnore() so we never try to modify a constant string.

Changed the USG define to HAVE_STRING_H.

Fixed the states.sed script so it only replaces "Input" in the correct
places.  I would like to use the \< \> word separator patterns but
they are not supported by all versions of sed.  This as least works.

Changed the detex.c target in the Makefile to use a temporary file
because I experienced problems (segmentation fault) with lex on
Solaris 2.1 when input was from stdin.


Modified (Version 2.7) -- September 10, 1997
Removed line breaks in detex.l between a few patterns and actions.  It
appears that flex is no longer able to handle this.  Thanks to Anthony
Harris <harris@hebb.neurology.pitt.edu> and Marty Leisner
<leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com> for reporting this.


Porting notes -- March 30, 1992
When using gcc, or compiling on a NeXT, you should compile with
-fwritable-strings.  With the change to SetInputPaths() in 2.6 this
should no longer be necessary.

On a NeXT, it has been reported that lex replaces the '\0' with NULL,
and then the compiler complains about it.  I think this is an old bug
that is no longer applicable.

July 30, 1993
The flex scanner generator does not work because it does not handle
input buffering the same way as lex.  I don't know of any reasonable
way to rewrite detex to get around this problem.

May 25, 1995
According to alain@ia1.u-strasbg.fr (Alain Ketterlin), using flex
allows 8-bit characters to be handled correctly.

Modified (Version 2.8) -- January 1, 2008
Added NCSA/University of Illinois Open Source License to facilitate
free redistribution.

(Version 2.8.1) -- October 2, 2008
First version of OpenDetex.
Making program compile on modern UNIX systems; many fixes in LaTeX
code handling (quotes, figure and table environments, headings and
many more).

(Version 2.8.2) -- February, 2016
Improved ANSI C compatibility. Used kpse_find_file() and
kpse_program_name(). Handle `\kern', allow `em/ex'for dimensions,
handle glue specs. Added the never-interactive option to prevent flex
from creating a problematic prototype for isatty(). Renamed
ERROR -> my_ERROR to avoid a conflict with WIN32 headers. Used binary
mode for output file (Peter Breitenlohner and Werner Lemberg)

Insert a space in place of right curly brace (Eric Miotto).

Provide 'make uninstall'. Install man page when running 'make install'.

(Version 2.8.3) -- February, 2018
Added -r option that replaces math environments with nouns and verbs in a way that keeps sentences readable. Thanks to Sophie Huiberts.

Changed Makefile to fix a Mac OS X problem where frequently an empty output file was produced.

Removed states.sed that modified detex.l to avoid Lex memory overrun - no longer needed on current machines. Added detex.c to the distributed package to allow compiling OpenDetex without having Flex.

Removed 'mathmatica' from the default list of environments which contents are ignored - 'mathmatica' is not supported by TeX. Added more ignored environments: algorithm, align, smallmatrix and several more.

Fixed compilation on Cygwin.

Removed special files for OS/2 - they required compilers that no longer exist. OpenDetex should be able to be compiled using GCC for OS/2.

(Version 2.8.4) -- July, 2018

Stoped generating additional spaces after commands (#41). Thanks to Martin Nowack.

Fixed space missing in output when two newlines follow a macro (#42). Thanks to sgerwk.

Started treating newlines in inline math as spaces (#45). Thanks to sgerwk.

(Version 2.8.5) -- January, 2019

Fixed man page on macOS (#47). Thanks to FX Coudert.

Added -v option for showing version.

(Version 2.8.6) -- January, 2020

Fixed buffer overflow (CVE-2019-19601 #60). Thanks to Akira Kakuto, Norbert Preining and TeX Live team.

(Version 2.8.7) -- June, 2020

Reduced size of .tar.bz2 package by excluding object file added by mistake.

Handle forcing placement with ! (#62). Thanks to schrc3b6.

Added option to print source information with -1 (#64). Thanks to Victor Cacciari Miraldo.

(Version 2.8.8) -- June, 2020

Fixed compilation on old compilers supported by TeX Live (#65). Thanks to Akira Kakuto and Hironobu Yamashita.

(Version 2.8.9) -- December, 2020

Include escaped percent sign in output (#70). Thanks to Max Leonhardt.

(Version 2.8.10) -- December, 2023

Fixes to man page. Thanks to kberry and Hilmar Preusse.

(Version 2.8.11) -- December, 2023

Fixed segmentation fault on unterminated \verb.
