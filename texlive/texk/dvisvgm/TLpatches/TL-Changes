Changes applied to the original dvisvgm source as obtained from:
	https://dvisvgm.de/Downloads/
	or (hopefully) https://ctan.org/pkg/dvisvgm

Update version in ./version.ac and ../README.
Update DATE and copyrights in configure.ac.

ver=3.NEW.VER
mv dvisvgm-src dvisvgm-prev
tar xf dvisvgm-$ver.tar.gz
mv dvisvgm-$ver dvisvgm-src
tar xf dvisvgm-$ver.tar.gz # again, so we can compare orig release to ours

# remove common and generated files:
cd dvisvgm-src
rm ar-lib compile config.guess config.sub depcomp install-sh
rm -rf autom4te.cache
rm ltmain.sh missing test-driver 
rm -f m4/l*                 # rm libtool-related, keep other m4 files
rm -f aclocal.m4 configure  # reduce chance of confusion?
#
# files to add:
svn status | sed -n 's/^\?//p'
svn add `!!`
svn status | sed -n 's/^\?//p'  # rerun, should be empty now
#
# files to remove:
svn status | sed -n 's/^\!//p'
svn rm `!!`
svn status | sed -n 's/^\!//p'  # rerun, should be empty now

# Update our ./configure.ac from upstream dvisvgm-src/configure.ac.
# See patch-04-configure for reference, but won't apply if there are any
# non-trivial changes. Best to check dvisvgm-prev/configure.ac vs. new:
cd ..
diff -u2 dvisvgm-{prev,$ver}/configure.ac
# and then install the changes in our configure.ac by hand as needed.

# patch to integrate into TL build; even more likely to need adjusting.
patch -d dvisvgm-src -p1 <TLpatches/patch-08-makefiles 

# remake autostuff (then make, etc., with fingers crossed).
autoreconf

# try build. Might need full rebuild due to C++.
make -C ../../Work/texk/dvisvgm

# try tests; they will fail due to dvisvgm version number,
# but make sure nothing else has changed.
make -C ../../Work/texk/dvisvgm check
#
# then update reference results:
\cp -f ../../Work/texk/dvisvgm/sample*.svg tests/
\cp -f ../../Work/texk/dvisvgm/upjf_full.svg tests/upjf.svg
\cp -f ../../Work/texk/dvisvgm/upjf1_full.svg tests/upjf1.svg
#
# check that only diffs are the version number:
svn diff tests
#
# and rerun make check, should pass now:
make -C ../../Work/texk/dvisvgm check

# before committing, update patches:
diff -u2 dvisvgm-$ver/configure.ac ./ >TLpatches/patch-04-configure
for m in `(cd ./dvisvgm-src && find -name Makefile.am -o -name defs.am)`; do \
  diff -u2 dvisvgm-{$ver,src}/$m; done >TLpatches/patch-08-makefiles

# commit:
svn commit -m"dvisvgm $ver" . ../README
