Changes applied to the original dvisvgm source as obtained from:

Update version in ./version.ac and ../README.
Update DATE and copyrights in configure.ac.

ver=3.NEW.VER
mv dvisvgm-src dvisvgm-prev
tar xf dvisvgm-$ver.tar.gz
mv dvisvgm-$ver dvisvgm-src
tar xf dvisvgm-$ver.tar.gz # again, so we can compare orig release to ours

# remove common and generated files:
cd dvisvgm-src
rm ar-lib compile config.guess config.sub depcomp install-sh
rm -rf autom4te.cache
rm ltmain.sh missing test-driver 
rm -f m4/l*                 # rm libtool-related, keep other m4 files
rm -f aclocal.m4 configure  # reduce chance of confusion?
#
# files to add:

Update our ./configure.ac from upstream dvisvgm-src/configure.ac.
See patch-04-configure for reference, but they won't apply as-is.
Probably easiest to check dvisvgm-prev/configure.ac
vs. new, and then install the changes in our configure.ac by hand.

# patch to integrate into TL build; will likely need adjusting also.
patch -d dvisvgm-src -p1 <TLpatches/patch-08-makefiles 

# remake autostuff (then make, etc., with fingers crossed).
autoreconf

# try build.
make -C ../../Work/texk/dvisvgm

# before committing, update patches:
diff -u2 dvisvgm-$ver/configure.ac ./ >TLpatches/patch-04-configure
for m in `(cd ./dvisvgm-src && find -name Makefile.am -o -name defs.am)`; do \
  diff -u2 dvisvgm-{$ver,src}/$m; done >TLpatches/patch-08-makefiles
