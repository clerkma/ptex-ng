1 Introduction
**************

This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as obtained
from TeX and its relatives.

   If GIF support is enabled, GIF output is chosen by using the 'dvigif'
binary or with the '--gif' option.

   It is intended to produce anti-aliased screen-resolution images as
fast as is possible.  The target audience is people who need to generate
and regenerate many images again and again.  The primary target is the
preview-latex (X)Emacs package, a package to preview formulas from
within (X)Emacs.  Yes, you get to see your formulas in the (X)Emacs
buffer, see <http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/preview-latex.html>.

   Another example is WeBWorK, an internet-based method for delivering
homework problems to students over the internet, giving students instant
feedback as to whether or not their answers are correct, see
<http://webwork.math.rochester.edu>.

   A more recent addition to the dvipng-using applications out there is
MediaWiki, the software behind Wikipedia and many other wikis out there.
Dvipng is used to render mathematical formulae from version 1.8.0 of
MediaWiki, see <http://www.mediawiki.org>.

   Other applications may also benefit, like web applications as
latex2html and WYSIWYG editors like LyX.

   The benefits of 'dvipng'/'dvigif' include

   * Speed.  It is a very fast bitmap-rendering code for DVI files,
     which makes it suitable for generating large amounts of images
     on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK and others.

   * It does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX
     finishes.  There is a '--follow' switch that makes dvipng wait at
     end-of-file for further output, unless it finds the POST marker
     that indicates the end of the DVI.

   * Interactive query of options.  dvipng can read options
     interactively through stdin, and all options are usable.  It is
     even possible to change the input file through this interface.

   * Supports PK, VF, PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, subfonts
     (i.e., as used in CJK-LaTeX), color specials, and inclusion of
     PostScript, PNG, JPEG or GIF images.

2 Installation
**************

Installing dvipng should be simple: merely './configure', 'make', and
'make install'.

* Prerequisites::
* Configure::
* Build/install::
* Installation outside the texmf tree::
* Advice for non-privileged users::


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Prerequisites,  Next: Configure,  Up: Installation

2.1 Prerequisites
=================

   * The GD Graphics Draw library, libgd

     The drawing library 'libgd' is necessary, and is downloadable at
     <https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/downloads>, and there are
     binary packages for most operating systems from their respective
     distributors.  In any case, the library installs using 'autoconf'
     so it should not be difficult for you to install it from source,
     and then proceed with installing dvipng.

   * The path-searching library kpathsea

     Kpathsea is most likely included in your LaTeX installation, but it
     may happen that ./configure does not find it; see below.  If you do
     not have it, download it from <http://www.ctan.org> and compile it.
     I have no experience with this, so I cannot help much here.

   * The font-rendering library FreeType 2

     While not strictly necessary, a recent FreeType 2 is recommended
     since dvipng currently will produce better-quality images when this
     library is available.  To take advantage of this, you should have
     at least FreeType 2.1.9.

     FreeType 2 will enable direct support for PostScript and TrueType
     fonts, so that dvipng will not need to generate bitmapped variants
     on disk of the TeX fonts since modern TeX distributions include
     PostScript versions of them.  Then, you can render images at
     different (and unusual) resolutions without cluttering the disk
     with lots of bitmapped fonts.

     Finally, it will enable subfont support in dvipng.  That is, if you
     want to render CJK-LaTeX characters, you must have FreeType 2
     installed.

   * libpng and libz

     To be able to compress and write PNG files to disk, dvipng (or
     really libgd) uses libpng which in turn uses libz.  These should be
     available on any modern system, if not, download them and install
     them.

   * The 'texinfo' package

     This is needed for building the documentation.

2.2 Configure
=============

The first step is to configure the source code, telling it where various
files will be.  To do so, run

     ./configure OPTIONS

   (Note: if you have fetched dvipng from CVS rather than a regular
release, you will have to first generate './configure' by running
'autoconf' 2.53 or later.)

   On many machines, you will not need to specify any options, but if
'configure' cannot determine something on its own, you'll need to help
it out.  For a list of the options type

     ./configure --help

   On some machines, the libraries will be installed in directories that
are not in the linker's search path.  This will generate an error when
running './configure', indicating that it cannot find libgd or
libkpathsea (most likely).  You then need to specify the path to the
respective library's object files.  They are typically called e.g.,
'libgd.a' or 'libgd.so'.  If they are located in e.g., '/sw/local/lib',
do

     ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/sw/local/lib

   If the library is available as a shared object file ('.so'), the
runtime linker may also need to be told where to find the library, then
use

     ./configure LDFLAGS='-L/sw/local/lib -R/sw/local/lib'

   When either of these is necessary, it is likely that the C header
files are also installed in directories that are not in the C
preprocessor's search path.  This will also generate an error when
running './configure', indicating that it cannot find e.g., 'gd.h' or
'kpathsea.h' (most likely).  You then need to specify the path to the
respective library's C header files.  If they are located in e.g.,
'/sw/local/include', do

     ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/local/include

   On my SUN Solaris workstation, I had to combine this into

     ./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/sw/local/include -I/sw/tex/teTeX/1.0/include'\
         LDFLAGS='-L/sw/local/lib -R/sw/local/lib -L/sw/tex/teTeX/1.0/lib/'

where the backslash denotes a continuation of the line.

2.3 Build/install
=================

Once 'configure' has been run, simply enter

     make

at the prompt to compile the C code, and build the documentation files.
To install the files into the locations chosen earlier, type

     make install

You may need special privileges to install, e.g., if you are installing
into system directories.


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Installation outside the texmf tree,  Next: Advice for non-privileged users,  Prev: Build/install,  Up: Installation

2.4 Installation outside the texmf tree
=======================================

In some cases, a dvipng binary installed outside the texmf tree will not
be able to find virtual fonts, or the PostScript font maps (normally
used by dvips).  This may be because _only_ $SELFAUTOLOC, $SELFAUTODIR,
and $SELFAUTOPARENT are used in the texmf tree configuration file
'texmf.cnf'.  If so, give the switch '--enable-selfauto-set' to
'./configure'.  This will make dvipng adjust these three internally so
that kpathsea thinks that dvipng _is_ installed in the texmf tree.


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Advice for non-privileged users,  Prev: Installation outside the texmf tree,  Up: Installation

2.5 Installation for non-privileged users
=========================================

Often people without system administration privileges want to install
software for their private use.  In that case you need to specify more
options to the 'configure' script, usually this is done by using the
'--prefix' option to the 'configure' script, and let it point to the
personal home directory.  In that way, resulting binaries will be
installed under the 'bin' subdirectory of your home directory, manual
pages under 'man' and so on.  That way, it is reasonably easy to
maintain a bunch of additional packages, since the prefix argument is
supported by most 'configure' scripts.

   You'll have to add something like '/home/myself/bin' to your 'PATH'
shell variable, if it isn't there already, and similarly set the
'INFOPATH' and 'MANPATH' variables to be able to access the
documentation.


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Basic usage,  Next: Command-line options,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

3 Basic usage of dvipng
***********************

To use dvipng at its simplest, simply type

     dvipng foo

where 'foo.dvi' is the output of TeX that you want to convert to PNG
format.  If there are four pages in 'foo.dvi', those pages will be
output as 'foo1.png', 'foo2.png', 'foo3.png', and 'foo4.png',
respectively.

   If you have enabled the PostScript font support (via FreeType), fonts
will be rendered as they are needed.  Otherwise, dvipng will use
bitmapped (PK) fonts, and if you use PK fonts that have not been used on
your system before, they may be automatically generated; this process
can take a few minutes, so progress reports appear by default.  The next
time the same font is used, it will have been saved on disk, so
rendering will go much faster.  (If dvipng tries to endlessly generate
the same fonts over and over again, something is wrong.  *Note
(kpathsea)Unable to generate fonts::.)

   Many options are available (see the next section).  For a brief
summary of available options, just type

     dvipng --help

4.1 Option summary
==================

Here is a handy summary of the options; it is printed out when you run
dvipng with no arguments or with the standard '--help' option.

     This is ./dvipng 1.17 Copyright 2002-2015, 2019 Jan-Ake Larsson

     Usage: ./dvipng [OPTION]... FILENAME[.dvi]
     Options are chosen to be similar to dvips' options where possible:
       -d #         Debug (# is the debug bitmap, 1 if not given)
       -D #         Output resolution
       -l #         Last page to be output
       -o f         Output file, '%d' is pagenumber

4.2 Option details
==================

Many of the parameterless options listed here can be turned off by
suffixing the option with a zero ('0'); for instance, to turn off page
reversal, use '-r0'.  Such options are marked with a trailing '*'.

'-'
     Read additional options from standard input after processing the
     command line.

'--help'
     Print a usage message and exit.

'--version'
     Print the version number and exit.

'-bd NUM'
'-bd COLOR_SPEC'
'-bd 'NUM COLOR_SPEC''
     Set the pixel width of the transparent border (default 0).  Using
     this option will make the image edges transparent, but it only
     affects pixels with the background color.  Giving a COLOR_SPEC will
     set the fallback color, to be used in viewers that cannot handle
     transparency (the default is the background color).  The color spec
     should be in TeX color \special syntax, e.g., 'rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0'.
     Setting the fallback color makes the default border width 1 px.
     *Note Color::.

'--bdpi NUM'
     This option only has an effect when using bitmapped (PK) fonts.
     The option sets the base (Metafont) resolution, both horizontal and
     vertical, to NUM dpi (dots per inch).  This option is necessary
     when manually selecting Metafont mode with the -mode option (see
     below).

'-bg COLOR_SPEC'
     Choose background color for the images.  This option will be
     ignored if there is a background color \special in the DVI. The
     color spec should be in TeX color \special syntax, e.g., 'rgb 1.0
     0.0 0.0'.  You can also specify 'Transparent' or 'transparent'
     which will give you a transparent background with the normal
     background as a fallback color.  A capitalized 'Transparent' will
     give a full-alpha transparency, while an all-lowercase
     'transparent' will give a simple fully transparent background with
     non-transparent antialiased pixels.  The latter would be suitable
     for viewers who cannot cope with a true alpha channel.  GIF images
     do not support full alpha transparency, so in case of GIF output,
     both variants will use the latter behaviour.  *Note Color::.

'-d NUM'
     Set the debug flags, showing what dvipng (thinks it) is doing.
     This will work unless dvipng has been compiled without the 'DEBUG'
     option (not recommended).  Set the flags as you need them, use '-d
     -1' as the first option for maximum output.  *Note Debug options::.

'-D NUM'
     Set the output resolution, both horizontal and vertical, to NUM dpi
     (dots per inch).

     One may want to adjust this to fit a certain text font size (e.g.,
     on a web page), and for a text font height of FONT_PX pixels (in
     Mozilla) the correct formula is
          DPI = FONT_PX * 72.27 / 10 [px * TeXpt/in / TeXpt]
     The last division by ten is due to the standard font height 10pt in
     your document, if you use 12pt, divide by 12.  Unfortunately, some
     proprietary browsers have font height in pt (points), not pixels.
     You have to rescale that to pixels, using the screen resolution
     (default is usually 96 dpi) which means the formula is
          FONT_PX = FONT_PT * 96 / 72 [pt * px/in / (pt/in)]
     On some high-res screens, the value is instead 120 dpi.  Good luck!

'--depth*'
     Report the depth of the image.  This only works reliably when the
     LaTeX style 'preview.sty' from preview-latex is used with the
     'active' option.  It reports the number of pixels from the bottom
     of the image to the baseline of the image.  This can be used for
     vertical positioning of the image in, e.g., web documents, where
     one would use (Cascading StyleSheets 1)
          <IMG SRC="FILENAME.PNG" STYLE="vertical-align: -DEPTHpx">
     The depth is a negative offset in this case, so the minus sign is
     necessary, and the unit is pixels (px).

'--dvinum*'
     Set this option to make the output page number be the TeX page
     numbers rather than the physical page number.  See the '-o' switch.

'-fg COLOR_SPEC'
     Choose foreground color for the images.  This option will be
     ignored if there is a foreground color \special in the DVI. The
     color spec should be in TeX color \special syntax, e.g., 'rgb 1.0
     0.0 0.0'.  *Note Color::.

'--follow*'
     Wait for data at end-of-file.  One of the benefits of dvipng is
     that it does not read the postamble, so it can be started before
     TeX finishes.  This switch makes dvipng wait at end-of-file for
     further output, unless it finds the POST marker that indicates the
     end of the DVI. This is similar to 'tail -f' but for DVI-to-PNG
     conversion.

'--freetype*'
     Enable/disable FreeType font rendering (default on).  This option
     is available if the FreeType2 font library was present at
     compilation time.  If this is the case, dvipng will have direct
     support for PostScript Type1 and TrueType fonts internally, rather
     than using 'gsftopk' for rendering the fonts.  If you have
     PostScript versions of Computer Modern installed, there will be no
     need to generate bitmapped (PK) variants on disk of these.  Then,
     you can render images at different (and unusual) resolutions
     without cluttering the disk with lots of bitmapped fonts.  One
     reason to disable FreeType font rendering would be to generate
     identical output on different platforms, since FreeType uses the
     native renderer and therefore can give slightly different output on
     each platform.

'--gamma NUM'
     Control the interpolation of colors in the greyscale anti-aliasing
     color palette.  Default value is 1.0.  For 0 < NUM < 1, the fonts
     will be lighter (more like the background), and for NUM > 1, the
     fonts will be darker (more like the foreground).

'--gif*'
     The images are output in the GIF format, if GIF support is enabled.
     This is the default for the 'dvigif' binary, which only will be
     available when GIF support is enabled.  GIF images are palette
     images (see the '--palette' option) and does not support true alpha
     channels (see the '--bg' option).  See also the '--png' option.

'--height*'
     Report the height of the image.  This only works reliably when the
     LaTeX style 'preview.sty' from preview-latex is used with the
     'active' option.  It reports the number of pixels from the top of
     the image to the baseline of the image.  The total height of the
     image is obtained as the sum of the values reported from '--height'
     and '--depth'.

'-l [=]NUM'
     The last page printed will be the first one numbered NUM.  Default
     is the last page in the document.  If NUM is prefixed by an equals
     sign, then it (and the argument to the '-p' option, if specified)
     is treated as a physical (absolute) page number, rather than a
     value to compare with the TeX '\count0' values stored in the DVI
     file.  Thus, using '-l =9' will end with the ninth page of the
     document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered.

'--mode MODE'
     This option only has an effect when using bitmapped (PK) fonts.
     Use MODE as the Metafont device name for the PK fonts (both for
     path searching and font generation).  This needs to be augmented
     with the base device resolution, given with the '--bdpi' option.
     See the file <ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/modes.mf> for a list of
     resolutions and mode names for most devices.  *Note
     (kpathsea)Unable to generate fonts::.

'-M*'
     This option only has an effect when using bitmapped (PK) fonts.  It
     turns off automatic PK font generation ('mktexpk').

'--nogs*'
     This switch prohibits the internal call to GhostScript for
     displaying PostScript specials.  '--nogs0' turns the call back on.

'--nogssafer*'
     Normally, if GhostScript is used to render PostScript specials, the
     GhostScript interpreter is run with the option '-dSAFER'.  The
     '--nogssafer' option runs GhostScript without '-dSAFER'.  The
     '-dSAFER' option in Ghostscript disables PostScript operators such
     as deletefile, to prevent possibly malicious PostScript programs
     from having any effect.

'--norawps*'
     Some packages generate raw PostScript specials, even non-rendering
     such specials.  This switch turns off the internal call to
     GhostScript intended to display these raw PostScript specials.
     '--norawps0' turns the call back on.

'-o NAME'
     Send output to the file NAME.  A single occurrence of '%d' or
     '%01d', ..., '%09d' will be exchanged for the physical page number
     (this can be changed, see the '--dvinum' switch).  The default
     output filename is 'FILE%d.png' where the input DVI file was
     'FILE.dvi'.

'-O X-OFFSET,Y-OFFSET'
     Move the origin by X-OFFSET,Y-OFFSET, a comma-separated pair of
     dimensions such as '.1in,-.3cm'.  The origin of the page is shifted
     from the default position (of one inch down, one inch to the right
     from the upper left corner of the paper) by this amount.

'-p [=]NUM'
     The first page printed will be the first one numbered NUM.  Default
     is the first page in the document.  If NUM is prefixed by an equals
     sign, then it (and the argument to the '-l' option, if specified)
     is treated as a physical (absolute) page number, rather than a
     value to compare with the TeX '\count0' values stored in the DVI
     file.  Thus, using '-p =3' will start with the third page of the
     document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered.

'--palette*'
     When an external image is included, 'dvipng' will automatically
     switch to truecolor mode, to avoid unnecessary delay and quality
     reduction, and enable the EPS translator to draw on a transparent
     background and outside of the boundingbox.  This switch will force
     palette (256-color) output and make 'dvipng' revert to opaque
     clipped image inclusion.  This will also override the '--truecolor'
     switch if present.

'--picky*'
     No images are output when a warning occurs.  Normally, dvipng will
     output an image in spite of a warning, but there may be something
     missing in this image.  One reason to use this option would be if
     you have a more complete but slower fallback converter.  Mainly,
     this is useful for failed figure inclusion and unknown \special
     occurrences, but warnings will also occur for missing or unknown
     color specs and missing PK fonts.

'--png*'
     The images are output in the PNG format.  This is the default for
     the 'dvipng' binary.  See also the '--gif' option.

'-pp FIRSTPAGE-LASTPAGE'
     Print pages FIRSTPAGE through LASTPAGE; but not quite equivalent to
     '-p FIRSTPAGE -l LASTPAGE'.  For example, when rendering a book,
     there may be several instances of a page in the DVI file (one in
     '\frontmatter', one in '\mainmatter', and one in '\backmatter').
     In case of several pages matching, '-pp FIRSTPAGE-LASTPAGE' will
     render _all_ pages that matches the specified range, while '-p
     FIRSTPAGE -l LASTPAGE' will render the pages from the _first_
     occurrence of FIRSTPAGE to the _first_ occurrence of LASTPAGE.
     This is the (undocumented) behaviour of dvips.  In dvipng you can
     give both kinds of options, in which case you get all pages that
     matches the range in '-pp' between the pages from '-p' to '-l'.
     Also multiple '-pp' options accumulate, unlike '-p' and '-l'.  The
     '-' separator can also be ':'.  Note that '-pp -1' will be
     interpreted as "all pages up to and including 1", if you want a
     page numbered -1 (only the table of contents, say) put '-pp -1--1',
     or more readable, '-pp -1:-1'.

'-q*'
     Run quietly.  Don't chatter about pages converted, etc. to standard
     output; report no warnings (only errors) to standard error.

'-Q NUM'
     Set the quality to NUM.  That is, choose the number of antialiasing
     levels for bitmapped fonts (PK), to be NUM*NUM+1.  The default
     value is 4 which gives 17 levels of antialiasing for antialiased
     fonts from these two.  If FreeType is available, its rendering is
     unaffected by this option.

'-r*'
     Toggle output of pages in reverse/forward order.  By default, the
     first page in the DVI is output first.

'--strict*'
     The program exits when a warning occurs.  Normally, dvipng will
     output an image in spite of a warning, but there may be something
     missing in this image.  One reason to use this option would be if
     you have a more complete but slower fallback converter.  See the
     '--picky' option above for a list of when warnings occur.

'-T IMAGE_SIZE'
     Set the image size to IMAGE_SIZE which can be either of 'bbox',
     'tight', or a comma-separated pair of dimensions HSIZE,VSIZE such
     as '.1in,.3cm'.  The default is 'bbox' which produces a PNG that
     includes all ink put on the page and in addition the DVI origin,
     located 1in from the top and 1in from the left edge of the paper.
     This usually gives whitespace above and to the left in the produced
     image.  The value 'tight' will make dvipng only include all ink put
     on the page, producing neat images.

'--truecolor*'
     This will make 'dvipng' generate truecolor output.  Note that
     truecolor output is automatic if you include an external image in
     your DVI, e.g., via a PostScript special (i.e., the 'graphics' or
     'graphicx' package).  This switch is overridden by the '--palette'
     switch.

'-v*'
     Enable verbose operation.  This will currently indicate what fonts
     is used, in addition to the usual output.

'--width*'
     Report the width of the image.  See also '--height' and '--depth'.

'-x NUM'
     This option is deprecated; it should not be used.  It is much
     better to select the output resolution directly with the '-D'
     option.  This option sets the magnification ratio to NUM/1000 and
     overrides the magnification specified in the DVI file.  Must be
     between 10 and 100000.  It is recommended that you use standard
     magstep values (1095, 1200, 1440, 1728, 2074, 2488, 2986, and so
     on) to help reduce the total number of PK files generated.  NUM may
     be a real number, not an integer, for increased precision.

'-z NUM'
     Set the PNG compression level to NUM.  This option is enabled if
     your 'libgd' is new enough.  The default compression level is 1,
     which selects maximum speed at the price of slightly larger PNGs.
     For an older 'libgd', the hard-soldered value 5 is used.  The
     include file 'png.h' says
          Currently, valid values range from 0 - 9, corresponding
          directly to the zlib compression levels 0 - 9 (0 - no
          compression, 9 - "maximal" compression).  Note that tests have
          shown that zlib compression levels 3-6 usually perform as well
          as level 9 for PNG images, and do considerably fewer
          calculations.  In the future, these values may not correspond
          directly to the zlib compression levels.

5 Graphics
**********

'dvipng' attempts to handle graphics as included by the 'graphicx' and
'graphics' packages, without the need of specifying a driver to these
packages.  This means that it recognizes the encapsulated postscript
inclusion meant for 'dvips', but is also able (from version 1.8) to
include bitmapped graphics.  It also tries to handle some of the raw
PostScript that is output from various packages.  Some of the
possibilities and problems are mentioned below.

* Menu:

* Encapsulated PostScript::    An internal call to GhostScript
* Bitmapped graphics::         PNG, JPEG and GIF
* Raw PostScript::             Ignore or give to GhostScript


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Encapsulated PostScript,  Next: Bitmapped graphics,  Up: Graphics

5.1 Encapsulated PostScript
===========================

When an EPS file is included, a call to GhostScript is performed to
produce a bitmapped image that can be included.  The default is to
produce an image with transparent background, at the same size as the
DVI page currently being converted to PNG, and include that as
foreground on the PNG. Of course, if the image is to be cropped, that is
done.  The included image will be a truecolor image, so for maximum
performance the output PNG will be in truecolor mode as well.

   This conversion needs the 'pngalpha' output device to be present in
your copy of GhostScript.  If that device is not present, or you use the
'--palette' switch or request GIF output, the fallback is to use the
'png16m' device to produce a cropped opaque image for inclusion.  Other
relevant switches are '--noghostscript' and '--nogssafer'.  *Note Option
details::.

   The most common problem with including graphics is an incorrect
bounding box.  Complain to whoever wrote the software that generated the
file if the bounding box is indeed incorrect.  An adjusted boundingbox
can be specified in the '\includegraphics' call, as in this example
(using 'graphicx'):

     \includegraphics[bb=10 20 100 200]{imagename.eps}


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Bitmapped graphics,  Next: Raw PostScript,  Prev: Encapsulated PostScript,  Up: Graphics

5.2 Bitmapped graphics
======================

dvipng can include PNG, JPEG and GIF graphics.  When including such
images via '\includegraphics' you need to specify the bounding box since
TeX itself cannot read them from the files in question.  The bounding
box size should be given as '0 0 w h' in pixels, e.g., if the file
'imagename.png' is 300x400 pixels, the inclusion would read

     \includegraphics[bb=0 0 300 400]{imagename.png}

   The default size is the image size in bp ("big points" in TeX
nomenclature or PostScript points as other people have it, 72 per inch).
That is, default resolution will be 72 dpi for included bitmaps, which
is the default size in the few other bitmap-capable drivers that are
known to me (dvipdfm and PDFLaTeX).

   If you want 100 dpi you need to specify the width accordingly.  You
just divide your image width by 100: a 135 pixel wide image at 100 dpi
will take up 1.35 inches.  If you want 200 dpi you divide by 200, and so
on.  Simple, eh?  The example above at 200 dpi would be 1.5 inches wide:

     \includegraphics[bb=0 0 300 400,witdh=1.5in]{imagename.png}


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Raw PostScript,  Prev: Bitmapped graphics,  Up: Graphics

5.3 Raw PostScript
==================

dvipng attempts to handle raw PostScript.  Rendering raw PostScript
specials is done on top of the page by including a transparent image
generated by the 'pngalpha' device in GhostScript (automatically
selecting 'truecolor' mode in dvipng).

   Included PostScript headers are respected, and if the header
'tex.pro' is included, dvipng also throws in 'color.pro' and
'special.pro'.  The package 'xcolor' includes its own headers with color
names, and this is not only kept as a PostScript header, but is also
read and interpreted by dvipng itself.  An attempt is also made to
respect the PGF header.  The non-rendering specials from 'hyperref' are
handled via some heuristics and do not give an error.

   Really rendering and moving things with raw PostScript specials is
more troublesome.  The \rotatebox macro serves as a good example.  The
dvips driver of the graphicx package surrounds DVI glyphs with
PostScript code so that after conversion by dvips, the glyphs (now
themselves in PostScript) will be rotated in the desired way.  dvipng
does not handle this, at present.  An attempt has been made to handle
the rendering specials output by PGF (tikz), and also PSTricks.  Some
things work, but others do not.  This is especially clear when mixing
PostScript and DVI rendering commands such as glyphs.  dvipng cannot at
present detect if PostScript code moves 'currentpoint' or rotates the
frame since GhostScript does not return such information.  A
recommendation would be to produce images from these packages as EPS
files and include them into your document in the standard manner.

   Another way to handle this would be to use a slower fallback (with
dvips and gs, for example).  If you want to disable raw PostScript
handling in dvipng, use the switch '--norawps'.  This switch turns off
the internal call to GhostScript intended to display these raw
PostScript specials.  Further, when dvipng encounters raw PostScript and
the gs call is turned off, it gives a warning.  It is now possible to
use the switch '--picky' to disable page rendering of pages with
warnings, and use the slower fallback for these pages.

6 Color
*******

To support color, dvipng recognizes a certain set of specials as
generated by the 'color' and 'xcolor' style files.  These specials start
with the keyword 'color' or the keyword 'background', followed by a
color specification.

* Menu:

* Color specifications::
* Color specials::


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Color specifications,  Next: Color specials,  Up: Color

6.1 Color specifications
========================

The color specification supported by dvipng is by-value or by-name.  The
by-value spec starts with the name of a color model (one of 'rgb',
'hsb', 'cmy', 'cmyk', or 'gray') followed by the appropriate number of
parameters.  Thus, the color specification 'rgb 0.3 0.4 0.5' would
correspond to the color that is '0.3 0.4 0.5' in its red, blue and green
values.  The color model used internally in dvipng is 'RGB' (discretized
to 256 levels), for details on the formulas used in conversion, see the
'xcolor' documentation.

   By-name color specifications are single (case-dependent) words and
are compared with color names defined in 'dvipsnam.def' (from the
'graphics' bundle), 'svgnam.def' and 'xcolor.sty' (from the 'xcolor'
bundle).  See the 'xcolor' documentation for a list of names and the
corresponding colors.

   On the command-line, the name 'Transparent' can also be used as an
argument to '--bg' to choose transparent background.  *Note Option
details::.


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Color specials,  Prev: Color specifications,  Up: Color

6.2 Color specials
==================

We will describe 'background' first, since it is the simplest.  The
'background' keyword must be followed by a color specification.  That
color specification is used as a fill color for the background.  The
last 'background' special on a page is the one that gets used, and is
used for the whole of the page image.  (This is possible because the
prescan phase of dvipng notices all of the color specials so that the
appropriate information can be written out during the second phase.)

   The 'color' special itself has three forms.  The first is just
'color' followed by a color specification.  In this case, the current
global color is set to that color; the color stack must be empty when
such a command is executed.

   The second form is 'color push' followed by a color specification.
This saves the current color on the color stack and sets the color to be
that given by the color specification.  This is the most common way to
set a color.

   The final form of the 'color' special is just 'color pop', with no
color specification; this says to pop the color last pushed on the color
stack from the color stack and set the current color to be that color.

   dvipng correctly handles these color specials across pages, even when
the pages are rendered repeatedly or in reverse order.
