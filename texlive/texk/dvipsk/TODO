TODO for dvips(k).  (Public domain.)

- see dvips items on tug.org/help (lots! both doc and code).
- use snprintf, not sprintf, if any question.
- comment line break http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/b8ed25cc6153d5c
- \special{map: ...} a la \pdfmapline (reinhardk 30dec06)
- maybe stuff from dvipsfnt.txt from yy
- dvips +ufoobar.map -> no error?

From Tom:

To document:
   Landscape mfmode
   HPS integration
   Separate EPSF file generation
   Better bbox support
   Comment elision now turned *off*
   Upleveling of font requirements
   Bitmap font descriptions

Questions:
   Should I eliminate PStfms/PSvfs/afm-extra?
   Should I eliminate PSlatex?  (my guess is yes)
   Partial type 1 downloading (Sergey Lesenko)
   HyperTeX support (Mark Doyle)
   Lots of little bugs/changes/fixes

Still todo:
- Make a better copyfile that handles Level 2 data better
- Add landscape mode def and code to select it.
- Sanitize; test on various systems
- Improve makefile!!!  Goal:  on a standard C installation (with stdlib
  and all) and a Unix machine using TDS, make it be just a `make' away.
- Improve diagnostics, especially when files not found.
- Eliminate `extern' declarations; use header files properly

Won't do:
- would be nice to report the full path of config.ps and psfonts.map,
etc., if !quiet, but unfortunately these are processed before the banner
is printed.  Can't move the banner earlier because we have to know if we
are being quiet or not.  So, leave as debugging output only.
