This file records noteworthy changes.  (Public domain.)

dvips 2024.1 (TeX Live 2024):
  Support for multibyte characters in virtual fonts to OFM fonts for (u)pTeX.

dvips 2023.1 (TeX Live 2023):
  Check --help and --version early to avoid looking for texmf.cnf.

dvips 2022.1 (TeX Live 2022):
  New option (and config file directive) -landscaperotate: try to
    automatically match rotated page content and paper sizes; in the past,
    this was done by default, but it is generally unnecessary nowadays,
    and can be troublesome when converting to PDF, so now the default is
    not to do this. This option re-enables the rotated matching.
  Use full font path (if specified) for tfm lookups, as with pk.

dvips 2021.1 (TeX Live 2021):
  Default title is now the basename of the input file instead of the
    full path, and can be overridden with new option -title.
  If an .eps or other image file is not found, dvips now exits unsuccessfully.
  Support new feature of virtual font to fallback Japanese font definition.

dvips 2020.1 (TeX Live 2020):
  Encodings for bitmap fonts:
    https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb40-2/tb125rokicki-type3search.pdf
  
dvips 5.999 (TeX Live 2019):
  Buffer overflows.

dvips 5.998 (TeX Live 2018):
  New JFM (Japanese font metrics) spec supported; compiler portability fixes.

dvips 5.997 (TeX Live 2017):
  Make the last papersize special win, to match dvipdfmx; the -L0 option
  or L0 config restores the previous behavior of the first special winning.
  
dvips 5.996 (TeX Live 2016):
  afm2tfm 8.4: only adjust heights of base characters upward for accent
  position, and new option -a to omit all adjustments.

dvips 5.995 (TeX Live 2015):
  Remove psfig support, as it is nonfree.

dvips 5.994 (TeX Live 2014):
  Omit UniqueID from subsets.

dvips 5.993 (TeX Live 2013):
  `m' value <= 0 now means no limit on vm.

dvips 5.992 (TeX Live 2012):
  `c' config file include directive.

dvips 5.991 (TeX Live 2011):
  Type 1 parsing bug fixes.
  Integer overflow bug fix.

dvips 5.99 (TeX Live 2010):
   Use the type1 path to search for Type 1 fonts.
   Support for Japanese pTeX.
   Numeric overflow and sprintf checks.
   Reformat sources.


dvips 5.86 notes:
   Minor improvements to epsf style file.
   Another patch to t1part.c to make it more liberal in accepting pfb/pfa
      font files.
   Added PS reencoding reimplementation by Rob Hutchings.
   Added 'F' in config file to send controlD.
   Added quick exit if -? or -v.
   Improved tex.lpro to fix a bug that showed up in distiller.
   Improved tex.lpro to work around a problem in certain Windows
      environments.
   Made dvips complain if it had to section a document.
   Eliminated use-after-free bug in hps.c.
   Fixed a problem in t1part for the Euro fonts with partial font downloading.
   Fixed a big problem in t1part for some font downloading due to
      uninitialized allocations.
   Added `unknown' paper size back to config.ps.
   Made t1part munge the UniqueID to prevent cache problems in Acrobat and
      other programs.
   Fixed parsing error when whitespace following '<' in psfonts.map.
   Made '<<' work correctly (disable partial font downloading for that
      particular font) in psfonts.map.

dvips 5.74 notes:

   The epsf.sty and epsf.tex files are now in the public domain.
   The t1part.c has been updated to support binary files with
       multiple binary sections.

dvips 5.72 notes:

   Bug fix in t1part.c???  I hope so!

   Debugging now turned on by default.  No real reason to turn it off.
   (Too many Linux versions of dvips without debugging have been
   distributed, and it makes it very difficult to help the users with
   their problems . . .)

dvips 5.62 notes:

   The makefile and config.ps and MakeTeXPK need to be modified to fit
   your site!
