dvips 5.86 notes:
   Minor improvements to epsf style file.
   Another patch to t1part.c to make it more liberal in accepting pfb/pfa
      font files.
   Added PS reencoding reimplementation by Rob Hutchings.
   Added 'F' in config file to send controlD.
   Added quick exit if -? or -v.
   Improved tex.lpro to fix a bug that showed up in distiller.
   Improved tex.lpro to work around a problem in certain Windows
      environments.
   Made dvips complain if it had to section a document.
   Eliminated use-after-free bug in hps.c.
   Fixed a problem in t1part for the Euro fonts with partial font downloading.
   Fixed a big problem in t1part for some font downloading due to
      uninitialized allocations.
   Added `unknown' paper size back to config.ps.
   Made t1part munge the UniqueID to prevent cache problems in Acrobat and
      other programs.
   Fixed parsing error when whitespace following '<' in psfonts.map.
   Made '<<' work correctly (disable partial font downloading for that
      particular font) in psfonts.map.

dvips 5.74 notes:

   The epsf.sty and epsf.tex files are now in the public domain.
   The t1part.c has been updated to support binary files with
       multiple binary sections.

dvips 5.72 notes:

   Bug fix in t1part.c???  I hope so!

   Debugging now turned on by default.  No real reason to turn it off.
   (Too many Linux versions of dvips without debugging have been
   distributed, and it makes it very difficult to help the users with
   their problems . . .)

dvips 5.62 notes:

   The makefile and config.ps and MakeTeXPK need to be modified to fit
   your site!
