.SH NAME
pk2bm \- create a bitmap from a TeX pkfont
.SH SYNOPSIS:
pk2bm [-bh] [-W\fIwidth\fP] [-H\fIheight\fP] -c\fIchar\fP pkfont 

pk2bm [-bh] [-W\fIwidth\fP] [-H\fIheight\fP] -o\fIoctchar\fP pkfont 
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program generates a bitmap (ASCII file) which can be used
to create X11 applications. The bitmap file consists of all pixels
of the specified character (via the -c or -o option) from 
the given pkfont. The format is described in bitmap(X11).
.PP
The pkfont is a packed fontfile generated by gftopk(TeX) from a 
gffont. A gffont is the output of METAFONT a program to design fonts
in a device independant way.
.PP
With the -b flag a bitmap is generated in which all black pixels are
drawn as a `*' and all white bits as a `.'. With the -h flag a 
hexadecimal bitmap dump is generated. 
.PP
The -W and/or -H options can be used to create a bitmap of
respectivally `width' and `height' pixels. The pk-bitmap will in
this case be centered according to these new dimensions.
.PP
The output is written to the standard output.
