dnl --------------------------------------------------------
dnl Keep Kpathsea package and shared library versions the same:
dnl   Only bug fixes:
dnl     a.b.c => a.b.c+1
dnl   Adding new interfaces (backwards compatible)
dnl   (maybe not necessary to be absolutely strict about this)
dnl     a.b.c => a.b+1.0
dnl   Modifying or revoking interfaces (not backwards compatible)
dnl   (we should never do this)
dnl     a.b.c => a+1.0.0
dnl
dnl   After a release:
dnl   increment and append "dev", to distinguish binaries built between
dnl   releases.
