.SH DESCRIPTION
This program extracts the metric and kerning information of a TrueType
font and converts it into metric files usable by \*(TX
(quite similar to
.B afm2tfm
which is part of the
.B dvips
package; please consult its info files for more details on the various
parameters (especially encoding files).
.PP
Since a TrueType font often contains more than 256\ glyphs, some means
are necessary to map a subset of the TrueType glyphs onto a \*(TX
font.
To do this, two mapping tables are needed: the first (called `input' or
`raw' encoding) maps the TrueType font to a raw \*(TX font (this mapping
table is used by both
.B ttf2tfm
and
.BR ttf2pk ),
and the second (called `output' or `virtual' encoding) maps the raw \*(TX
font to another (virtual) \*(TX
font, providing all kerning and ligature information needed by \*(TX.
.PP
This two stage mapping has the advantage that one raw font can be
accessed with various \*(LX
encodings (e.g.\ T1 and OT1) via the virtual font mechanism, and just
one
.C PK
file is necessary.
.PP
For CJKV (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/old Vietnamese) fonts, a different
mechanism is provided (see
.B "SUBFONT DEFINITION FILES"
below).
.
.
.SH PARAMETERS
Most of the command line switch names are the same as in
.B afm2tfm
for convenience.
One or more space characters between an option and its value is mandatory;
options can't be concatenated.
For historical reasons, the first parameter can
.I not
be a switch but must be the font name.
.TP
.BI \-c \ caps-height-factor
The height of small caps made with the
.B \-V
switch.
Default value of this real number is\ 0.8 times the height of uppercase
glyphs.
.IP
Will be ignored in subfont mode.
.TP
.BI \-e \ extension-factor
The extension factor to stretch the characters horizontally.
Default value of this real number is\ 1.0; if less than\ 1.0, you get a
condensed font.
.TP
.BI \-E \ encoding-id
The TrueType encoding ID.
Default value of this non-negative integer is\ 1.
.IP
Will be ignored if
.B \-N
is used.
.TP
.BI \-f \ font-index
The font index in a TrueType Collection.
Default is the first font (index\ 0).
[TrueType collections are usually found in some CJK fonts; e.g.\ the first
font index specifies glyphs and metrics for horizontal writing, and the
second font index does the same for vertical writing.
TrueType collections usually have the extension `\c
.C \&.ttc '.]
.IP
Will be ignored for ordinary TrueType fonts.
.TP
.B \-l
Create ligatures in subfonts between first and second bytes of all the
original character codes.
Example:  Character code\ 0xABCD maps to character position\ 123 in
subfont\ 45.
Then a ligature in subfont\ 45 between position 0xAB and\ 0xCD pointing
to character\ 123 will be produced.
The fonts of the Korean H\*(LX
package use this feature.
Note that this option generates correct ligatures only for TrueType fonts
where the input cmap is identical to the output encoding.
In case of H\*(LX, TTFs must have platform ID\ 3 and encoding ID\ 5.
.IP
Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.
.TP
.BI \-L \ ligature-file
Same as
.BR \-l ,
but character codes for ligatures are specified in
.IR \%ligature-file .
For example, `\c
.C \-L\ \%KS-HLaTeX '
generates correct ligatures for the Korean H\*(LX
package regardless of the platform and encoding ID of the used TrueType
font (the file
.C KS-HLaTeX.sfd
is part of the ttf2pk package).
.IP
Ligature files have the same format and extension as
.C SFD
files.
This option will be ignored if not in subfont mode.
.TP
.B \-n
Use PS names (of glyphs) of the TrueType font.
Only glyphs with a valid entry in the selected cmap are used.
.IP
Will be ignored in subfont mode.
.TP
.B \-N
Use only PS names of the TrueType font.
No cmap is used, thus the switches
.B \-E
and
.B \-P
have no effect, causing a warning message.
.IP
Will be ignored in subfont mode.
.TP
.B \-O
Use octal values for all character codes in the
.C VPL
file rather than names; this is useful for symbol or CJK fonts where
character names such as `A' are meaningless.
.TP
.BI \-p \ inencfile
The input encoding file name for the TTF\(->raw\ \*(TX
mapping.
This parameter has to be specified in a map file
(default:
.C \%ttfonts.map )
recorded in
.C \%ttf2pk.cfg
for successive
.B ttf2pk
calls.
.IP
Will be ignored in subfont mode.
.TP
.BI \-P \ platform-id
The TrueType platform ID.
Default value of this non-negative integer is\ 3.
.IP
Will be ignored if
.B \-N
is used.
.TP
.B \-q
Make
.B ttf2tfm
quiet.
It suppresses any informational output except warning and error
messages.
For CJK fonts, the output can get quite large if you don't specify
this switch.
.TP
.BI \-r \ old-glyphname\ new-glyphname
Replaces
.I \%old-glyphname
with
.IR \%new-glyphname .
This switch is useful if you want to give an unnamed glyph (i.e., a glyph
which can be represented with `.gXXX' or `.cXXX' only) a name or if you want
to rename an already existing glyph name.
You can't use the `.gXXX' or `.cXXX' glyph name constructs for
.IR \%new-glyphname ;
multiple occurrences of
.B \-r
are possible.
.IP
If in subfont mode or if no encoding file is specified, this switch is
ignored.
.TP
.BI \-R \ replacement-file
Use this switch if you have many replacement pairs; they can be  collected
in a file which should have `\c
.C \&.rpl '
as extension.
The syntax used in such replacement files is simple: Each non-empty
line must contain a pair `\c
.IR "\%old-glyphname \%new-glyphname" '
separated by whitespace (without the quotation marks).
A percent sign starts a line comment; you can continue a line on the next
line with a backslash as the last character.
.IP
If in subfont mode or if no encoding file is specified, this switch is
ignored.
.TP
.BI \-s \ slant-factor
The obliqueness factor to slant the font, usually much smaller than\ 1.
Default of this real number is\ 0.0; if the value is larger than zero,
the characters slope to the right, otherwise to the left.
.TP
.BI \-t \ outencfile
The output encoding file name for the virtual font(s).
Only characters in the raw \*(TX
font are used.
.IP
Will be ignored in subfont mode.
.TP
.BI \-T \ inoutencfile
This is equivalent to
.RB ` \-p
.I inoutencfile
.B \-t
.IR inoutencfile '.
.IP
Will be ignored in subfont mode.
.TP
.B \-u
Use only those characters specified in the output encoding, and no
others.
By default,
.B ttf2tfm
tries to include all characters in the virtual font, even those not
present in the encoding for the virtual font (it puts them into
otherwise-unused positions, rather arbitrarily).
.IP
Will be ignored in subfont mode.
.TP
.BI \-v \ vplfile
Output a
.C VPL
file in addition to the
.C TFM
file.
If no output encoding file is specified,
.B ttf2tfm
uses a default font encoding (cmtt10).
.B Note:
Be careful to use different names for the virtual font and the raw font!
.IP
Will be ignored in subfont mode.
.TP
.BI \-V \ scvplfile
Same as
.BR \-v ,
but the virtual font generated is a pseudo small caps font obtained by
scaling uppercase letters by\ 0.8 (resp. the value specified with
.BR \-c )
to typeset lowercase.
This font handles accented letters and retains proper kerning.
.IP
Will be ignored in subfont mode.
.TP
.B \-w
Generate PostScript encoding vectors containing glyph indices, primarily
used to embed TrueType fonts in pdf\*(TX.
.B ttf2tfm
takes the
.C TFM
names and replaces the suffix with
.C \&.enc ;
that is, for files
.C foo01.tfm ,
.C foo02.tfm ,\ \&.\|.\|.\&
it creates
.C foo01.enc ,
.C foo02.enc ,\ \&.\|.\|.\|\&
at the same place.
.IP
Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.
.TP
.B \-x
Rotate all glyphs by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
If no
.B \-y
parameter is given, the rotated glyphs are shifted down vertically
by\ 0.25em.
.IP
Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.
.TP
.BI \-y \ vertical-shift-factor
Shift down rotated glyphs by the given amount (the unit is
.IR em ).
.IP
Ignored if not in subfont mode or glyphs are not rotated.
.TP
.B \-\^\-version
Shows the current version of
.B ttf2tfm
and the used file search library (e.g.
.BR kpathsea ).
.TP
.B \-\^\-help
Shows usage information.
.PP
If no
.C TFM
file name is given, the name of the
.C TTF
file is used, including the full path and replacing the extension with `\c
.C \&.tfm '.
.
.
.SH CMAPS
Contrary to Type\ 1 PostScript fonts (but similar to the new CID
PostScript font format), most TrueType fonts have more than one native
mapping table, also called `cmap', which maps the (internal) TTF glyph
indices to the (external) TTF character codes.
Common examples are a mapping table to Unicode encoded character
positions, and the standard Macintosh mapping.

To specify a TrueType mapping table, use the options
.B \-P
and
.BR \-E .
With
.B \-P
you specify the platform ID; defined values are:
.PP
.TS 
l l.
\fIplatform\fP	\fIplatform ID (pid)\fP
_
Apple Unicode	0
Macintosh	1
ISO     	2
Microsoft	3
.TE
.PP
The encoding ID depends on the platform.
For pid=0, we ignore the
.B \-E
parameter (setting it to zero) since the mapping table is always
Unicode version\ 2.0.
For pid=1, the following table lists the defined values:
.PP
.RS
platform ID = 1
.RE
.TS
l l.
\fIscript\fP	\fIencoding ID (eid)\fP
_
Roman   	0
Japanese	1
Chinese 	2
Korean  	3

.TE
.PP
The program will abort if you specify an invalid platform/encoding ID
pair.
It will then show the possible pid/eid pairs.
Please note that most fonts have at most two or three cmaps, usually
corresponding to the pid/eid pairs (1,0), (3,0), or (3,1) in case of
Latin based fonts.
Valid Microsoft fonts should have a (3,1) mapping table, but some
fonts exist (mostly Asian fonts) which have a (3,1) cmap not encoded
in Unicode.
The reason for this strange behavior is the fact that some old
MS\ Windows versions will reject fonts having a non-(3,1) cmap (since
all non-Unicode Microsoft encoding IDs are for Asian MS\ Windows
versions).
.PP
The
.B \-P
and
.B \-E
options of
.B ttf2tfm
must be equally specified for
.BR ttf2pk ;
the corresponding parameters in a map file are `Pid' and `Eid',
respectively.
.PP
The default pid/eid pair is (3,1).
.PP
Similarly, an
.B \-f
option must be specified as `Fontindex' parameter in a map file.
.PP
If you use the
.B \-N
switch, all cmaps are ignored, using only the PostScript names in the
TrueType font.
The corresponding option in a map file is \%`PS=Only'.
If you use the
.B \-n
switch, the default glyph names built into
.B ttf2tfm
are replaced with the PS glyph names found in the font.
In many cases this is not what you want because the glyph names in the
font are often incorrect or non-standard.
The corresponding option in a map file is \%`PS=Yes'.
.PP
Single replacement glyph names specified with
.B \-r
must be given directly as `\c
.IR "old-glyphname new-glyphname" '
in a map file;
.B \-R
is equivalent to the `Replacement' option.
.
.
.SH INPUT AND OUTPUT ENCODINGS
You must specify the encoding vectors from the TrueType font to the
raw \*(TX
font and from the raw \*(TX
font to the virtual \*(TX
font exactly as with
.BR afm2tfm ,
but you have more possibilities to address the character codes.
[With `encoding vector' a mapping table with 256\ entries in form of a
PostScript vector is meant; see the file
.C \%T1-WGL4.enc
of this package for an example.]
With
.BR afm2tfm ,
you must access each glyph with its Adobe glyph name, e.g.\ \c
\%`/quotedsingle' or \%`/Acircumflex'.
This has been extended with
.BR ttf2tfm ;
now you can (and sometimes must) access the code points and/or glyphs
directly, using the following syntax for specifying the character position
in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal notation:
`/.c\c
.IR <decimal-number> ',
`/.c0\c
.IR <octal-number> ',
or `/.c0x\c
.IR <hexadecimal-number> '.
Examples: \%`/.c72', \%`/.c0646', \%`/.c0x48'.
To access a glyph index directly, use the character `g' instead of `c' in
the just introduced notation.
Example: \%`/.g0x32'.
[Note: The `.cXXX' notation makes no sense if
.B \-N
is used.]
.PP
For pid/eid pairs (1,0) and (3,1), both
.B ttf2tfm
and
.B ttf2pk
recognize built-in default Adobe glyph names; the former follows the names
given in Appendix\ E of the book `Inside Macintosh', volume\ 6, the latter
uses the names given in the TrueType Specification (WGL4, a Unicode subset).
Note that Adobe names for a given glyph are often not unique and do
sometimes differ, e.g., many PS fonts have the glyph `mu', whereas this
glyph is called `mu1' in the WGL4 character set to distinguish it from the
real Greek letter mu.
Be also aware that OpenType (i.e. TrueType\ 2.0) fonts use an updated WGL4
table; we use the data from the latest published TrueType specification
(1.66).
You can find those mapping tables in the source code file
.C \%ttfenc.c .
.PP
On the other hand, the switches
.B \-n
and
.B \-N
makes
.B ttf2tfm
read in and use the PostScript names in the TrueType font itself (stored
in the `post' table) instead of the default Adobe glyph names.
.PP
Use the
.B \-r
switch to remap single glyph names and
.B \-R
to specify a file containing replacement glyph name pairs.
.PP
If you don't select an input encoding, the first 256\ glyphs of the
TrueType font with a valid entry in the selected cmap will be mapped
to the \*(TX
raw font (without the
.B \-q
option,
.B ttf2tfm
prints this mapping table to standard output), followed by all glyphs
not yet addressed in the selected cmap.
However, some code points for the (1,0) pid/eid pair are omitted since
they do not represent glyphs useful for \*(TX:
0x00 (null), 0x08 (backspace), 0x09 (horizontal tabulation), 0x0d
(carriage return), and 0x1d (group separator).
The `invalid character' with glyph index\ 0 will be omitted too.
.PP
If you select the
.B \-N
switch, the first 256\ glyphs of the TrueType font with a valid PostScript
name will be used in case no input encoding is specified.
Again, some glyphs are omitted:  `.notdef', `.null', and
`nonmarkingreturn'.
.PP
If you don't select an  output encoding,
.B ttf2tfm
uses the same mapping table as
.B afm2tfm
would use (you can find it in the source code file
.C \%texenc.c );
it corresponds to \*(TX
typewriter text.
Unused positions (either caused by empty code points in the mapping
table or missing glyphs in the TrueType font) will be filled (rather
arbitrarily) with characters present in the input encoding but not
specified in the output encoding (without the
.B \-q
option
.B ttf2tfm
prints the final output encoding to standard output).
Use the
.B \-u
option if you want only glyphs in the virtual font which are defined
in the output encoding file, and nothing more.
.PP
One feature missing in
.B afm2tfm
has been added which is needed by \*(LX's T1 encoding:
.B ttf2tfm
will construct the glyph `Germandbls' (by simply concatenating two `S'
glyphs) even for normal fonts if possible.
It appears in the glyph list as the last item, marked with an asterisk.
Since this isn't a real glyph it will be available only in the virtual
font.
.PP
For both input and output encoding, an empty code position is
represented by the glyph name \%`/.notdef'.
.PP
In encoding files, you can use `\\' as the final character of a line to
indicate that the input is continued on the next line.
The backslash and the following newline character will be removed.
.PP
.
.
.SH SUBFONT DEFINITION FILES
CJKV (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/old Vietnamese) fonts usually contain
several thousand glyphs; to use them with \*(TX
it is necessary to split such large fonts into subfonts.
Subfont definition files (usually having the extension `\c
.C \&.sfd ')
are a simple means to do this smoothly.
.PP
A subfont file name usually consists of a prefix, a subfont infix, and
a postfix (which is empty in most cases), e.g.
.PP
.in +2m
ntukai23 \(-> prefix: ntukai, infix: 23, postfix: (empty)
.PP
Here the syntax of a line in an
.C SFD
file, describing one subfont:
.in +2m
.TP
.I <whitespace> <infix> <whitespace> <ranges> <whitespace>
.sp
.TP
.IR <infix> \ :=
anything except whitespace.
It is best to use only alphanumerical characters.
.TP
.IR <whitespace> \ :=
space, formfeed, carriage return, horizontal and vertical tabs -- no
newline characters.
.TP
.IR <ranges> \ :=
.IR "<ranges> <whitespace> <codepoint>" \ |
.br
.IR "<ranges> <whitespace> <range>" \ |
.br
.I <ranges> <whitespace> <offset> <whitespace> <range>
.TP
.IR <codepoint> \ :=
.I <number>
.br
.TP
.IR <range> \ :=
.IR <number> \ `_' \ <number>
.br
.TP
.IR <offset> \ :=
.IR <number> \ `:'
.TP
.IR <number> \ :=
hexadecimal (prefix `0x'), decimal, or octal (prefix `0')
.PP
A line can be continued on the next line with a backslash ending the line.
The ranges must not overlap; offsets have to be in the range 0-255.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.in +2m
The line
.PP
.in +4m
.C "03   10: 0x2349 0x2345_0x2347"
.PP
.in +2m
assigns to the code positions 10, 11, 12, and\ 13 of the subfont
having the infix `03' the character codes 0x2349, 0x2345, 0x2346, and
0x2347 respectively.
.PP
The
.C SFD
files in the distribution are customized for the CJK package for
\*(LX.
.PP
You have to embed the
.C SFD
file name into the
.C TFM
font name (at the place where the infix will appear) surrounded by two
`@' signs, on the command line resp.\ a map file;
both
.B ttf2tfm
and
.B ttf2pk
switch then to subfont mode.
.PP
It is possible to use more than a single
.C SFD
file by separating them with commata and no whitespace; for a given
subfont, the first file is scanned for an entry, then the next file,
and so on.
Later entries override entries found earlier (possibly only partially).
For example, the first
.C SFD
file sets up range 0x10-0xA0, and the next one modifies entries
0x12 and 0x25.
As can be easily seen, this algorithm allows for adding and replacing,
but not for removing entries.
.PP
Subfont mode disables the options 
.BR \-n ,
.BR \-N ,
.BR \-p ,
.BR \-r ,
.BR \-R ,
.BR \-t ,
.BR \-T ,
.BR \-u ,
.BR \-v ,
.BR \-V
and
.B \-w
for
.BR ttf2tfm ;
similarly, no `Encoding' or `Replacement' parameter is allowed in
a map file.
Single replacement glyph names are ignored too.
.PP
.B ttf2tfm
will create all subfont
.C TFM
files specified in the
.C SFD
files (provided the subfont contains glyphs) in one run.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.in +2m
The call
.PP
.in +4m
.C "ttf2tfm ntukai.ttf ntukai@Big5,Big5-supp@"
.PP
.in +2m
will use
.C Big5.sfd

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
ttf2tfm returns 0 on success and 1 on error; warning and error
messages are written to standard error.
.
.
.SH "SOME NOTES ON FILE SEARCHING"
Both
.B ttf2pk
and
.B ttf2tfm
use either the
.BR kpathsea ,
.BR emtexdir ,
or
.B MiK\*(TX
library for searching files 
.RB ( emtexdir
will work only on operating systems which have an MS-DOSish background, i.e.
MS-DOS, OS/2, Windows;
.B Mik\*(TX
is specific to MS Windows).
.PP
As a last resort, both programs can be compiled without a search library;
the searched files must be then in the current directory or specified with a
path.
Default extensions will be appended also (with the exception that only `\c
.C \&.ttf '
is appended and not `\c
.C \&.ttc ').
.
.
.SS kpathsea
The actual version of kpathsea is displayed on screen if you call
either
.B ttf2pk
or
.B ttf2tfm
with the
.B \-\^\-version
command line switch.
.PP
Here is a table of the file type and the corresponding
.B kpathsea
variables.
.C TTF2PKINPUTS
and
.C TTF2TFMINPUTS
are program specific environment variables introduced in
.B kpathsea
version\ 3.2:
.PP
.RS
.TS
l l.
\&.ttf and .ttc	TTFONTS
ttf2pk.cfg  	TTF2PKINPUTS
\&.map  	TTF2PKINPUTS
\&.enc  	TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
\&.rpl  	TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
\&.tfm  	TFMFONTS
\&.sfd  	TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
.TE
.RE

.PP
Please consult the info files of
.B kpathsea
for details on these variables.
.PP
You should set the
.C TEXMFCNF
variable to the directory where your
.C texmf.cnf
configuration file resides.
.PP
Here is the proper command to find out to which value a
.B kpathsea
variable is set (we use
.C TTFONTS
as an example).
This is especially useful if a variable isn't set in
.C texmf.cnf
or in the environment, thus pointing to the default value which is
hard-coded into the
.B kpathsea
library.
.PP
.RS
.C "kpsewhich -progname=ttf2tfm -expand-var='$TTFONTS'"
.RE
.PP
We select the program name also since it is possible to specify
variables which are searched only for a certain program -- in our
example it would be
.C TTFONTS.ttf2tfm .
.PP
A similar but not identical method is to say
.PP
.in +2m
.C "kpsewhich -progname=ttf2tfm -show-path='truetype fonts'"
.PP
[A full list of format types can be obtained by saying `\c
.C "kpsewhich --help" '
on the command line prompt.]
This is exactly how
.B ttf2tfm
(and
.BR ttf2pk )
searches for files; the disadvantage is that all variables are expanded
which can cause very long strings.
.
.
.SS emtexdir
Here the list of suffixes and their related environment variables to be
set in
.C autoexec.bat
(resp. in
.C config.sys
for OS/2):
.PP
.RS
.TS
l l.
\&.ttf and .ttc	TTFONTS
ttf2pk.cfg	TTFCFG
\&.map  	TTFCFG
\&.enc  	TTFCFG
\&.rpl  	TTFCFG
\&.tfm  	TEXTFM
\&.sfd  	TTFCFG
.TE
.RE
.PP
If one of the variables isn't set, a warning message is emitted.
The current directory will always  be searched.
As usual, one exclamation mark appended to a directory path causes
subdirectories one level deep to be searched, two exclamation marks cause
all subdirectories to be searched.
Example:
.PP
.in +2m
.C TTFONTS=c:\\\\fonts\\\\truetype!!;d:\\\\myfonts\\\\truetype!
.PP
Constructions like `\c
.C c:\\\\fonts!!\\\\truetype '
aren't possible.
.
.
.SS MiK\*(TX
Both
.B ttf2tfm
and
.B ttf2pk
have been fully integrated into
.BR MiK\*(TX .
Please refer to the documentation of
.B MiK\*(TX
for more details on file searching.

.SH PROBLEMS
Many
.B vptovf
implementations allow only 100\ bytes for the
.C TFM
header (the limit is 1024 in the
.C TFM
file format itself): 8\ bytes for checksum and design size, 40\ bytes for the
family name, 20\ bytes for the encoding, and 4\ bytes for a face byte.
There remain only 28\ bytes for some additional information which is used by
.B ttf2tfm
for an identification string (which is essentially a copy of the command
line), and this limit is always exceeded.

The optimal solution is to increase the value of
.I \%max_header_bytes
in the file
.C vptovf.web
(and probably
.C pltotf.web
too) to, say,\ 400
and recompile
.B vptovf
(and
.BR pltotf ).
Otherwise you'll get some (harmless) error messages like
.PP
.in +2m
.C "This HEADER index is too big for my present table size"
.PP
which can be safely ignored.
