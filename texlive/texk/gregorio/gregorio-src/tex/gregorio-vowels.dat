# Comments begin with a hash symbol and end at the end of the line.  These two
# lines are comments.

# In general, Gregorio does no case folding, so upper- and lower-case
# characters and combinations thereof should be listed.

# The "alias" keyword indicates that a name is an alias for a given language.
# The "alias" keyword must be followed by the name of the alias in square
# brackets, the "to" keyword, the name of the target language in square
# brackets, and a semicolon.  For best performance, aliases should precede the
# language they are aliasing.
alias [english] to [en];
alias [English] to [en];
alias [eng] to [en];

# The "language" keyword indicates that the rules which follow are for the
# specified language.  It must be followed by the language name enclosed in
# square brackets and a semicolon.  The language specified applies until the
# next language statement.
language [en];

# The "vowel" keyword indicates that the characters which follow, until the
# next semicolon, should be considered vowels.  There may be multiple "vowel"
# statements, and the characters following all of them will be considered
# vowels.
vowel aàáâAÀÁÂ;
vowel eèéêëEÈÉÊË;
vowel iìíîIÌÍÎ;
vowel oòóôOÒÓÔ;
vowel uùúûUÙÚÛ;
vowel yỳýYỲÝ;
vowel æǽÆǼ;
vowel œŒ;

# The "prefix" keyword lists strings of characters which end in a vowel, but
# when followed by a sequence of vowels, SHOULD NOT be considered part of the
# vowel sound.  These strings follow the keyword and must be separated by space
# and end with a semicolon.  There may be multiple "prefix" statements, and all
# will apply.  Examples of prefixes include "i" and "u" in Latin and "qu" in
# English.
prefix qu Qu qU QU;
prefix gu Gu gU GU;
prefix y Y;

# The "suffix" keyword lists strings of characters which don't start with a
# vowel, but when appearing after a sequence of vowels, SHOULD be considered
# part of the vowel sound.  These strings follow the keyword and must be
# separated by space and end with a semicolon.  There may be multiple "suffix"
# statements, and all will apply.  Examples of suffixes include "w" and "we" in
# English and "y" in Spanish.
suffix w W;
suffix we We wE WE;

# The "secondary" keyword lists strings of characters which do not contain
# vowels, but for which, when there are no vowels present in a syllable, define
# the center of the syllable.  These strings follow the keyword and must be
# separated by space and end with a semicolon.  Examples of secondary sequences
# include "w" from Welsh loanwords in English and the syllabic consonants "l"
# and "r" in Czech.
secondary w W;
