THE TeX LOG FILE
----------------

TeX uses three low-level commands for logging:

 1. \message -> outputs to both the console and the log file (most
    low-level TeX messages, such as open/close files, shipouts etc.
    behave *more or less* as if they were generated by \message)

 2. \write with an unallocated stream identifier (typically, 0) ->
    also outputs to both the console and the log file.

 2. \write with a negative stream identifier (typically, -1) -> outputs
    to the log file only

\write and \message behave differently:

 * Normally, \write appends a line feed character (LF) to the text, so
   a sequence of \write commands results in multiple lines.

 * \message checks whether the last thing that was sent out was another
   \message; if so, it adds a space character and outputs the text (both
   the previous text and the new one are on the same line, separated by
   a space), otherwise it just outputs the text (in this case, the new
   text is at the beginning of a line). Note, however, that there are
   some \message's that are not separated by spaces, such as "))".
   Also, in most cases (I could not figure out when this fails, but it
   happens often), if \message realizes the new text will not fit in
   the current line (the line would exceed max_print_line characters),
   instead of wrapping the line as usual, it may output a LF and start
   the text on a new line.

 * \write also checks if the last thing that was sent out was a message;
   if so, it sends LF before the text, so that it starts at the
   beginning of a line (it also sends LF after the text too, as always)

Therefore, in the console, text output with \write always appears on a
new line. A sequence of calls to \message also always starts on a new
line, but the texts of all of them appear on the same line, separated
by spaces.

However, things get messy in the log file. Basically, \message and
\write0 modify the same filedescriptor, while \write-1 modifies a
different filedescriptor. This means \message and \write0 are unaware
of \write-1 and vice-versa. As a result, the spaces and LFs that are
added according to what is output to the console get mixed up with what
is written only to the log file with \write-1. Therefore, there may be
unexpected empty lines or lines that start with a space character in
the log file.

The LaTeX command \GenericInfo uses \write-1, while \GenericWarning
uses \write0. TeX and LaTeX also define \wlog, which is an alias for
\write-1; LaTeX defines \typeout, which is an alias for \write0. Some
packages define their own aliases; for example, pgfcore.code.tex does
\def\pgf@typeout{\immediate\write0}, graphics.sty does \let\Gin@log\wlog,
etc. Package infwarerr provides a compatibility layer for the LaTeX
standard logging commands, so that they can be used both in LaTeX and
in plain TeX, as \@PackageInfo, \@ClassWarning etc.

With that in mind, we will consider that there are five kinds of message
in the LaTeX log file:

 * Ordinary messages -> messages that start at the beginning of the line
   and end at the end of the line (they are created with \write), such as

       Document Class: book 2019/08/27 v1.4j Standard LaTeX document class

       For additional information on amsmath, use the `?' option.

       \openout4 = `somefile'.

 * Short messages -> messages that may begin/end anywhere on a line,
   because the line they are in may contain multiple messages of
   this type (they are created with \message), such as

       ASCII Hyphenation patterns for American English

       ) (/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/iftex/iftex.sty
       -> these mean 'close last file' and 'open file .../iftex.sty'

       (/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/etoolbox/etoolbox.sty)
       -> these mean 'open file .../etoolbox.sty' and 'close last file'
          (which is etoolbox.sty, obviously)

       ))
       -> these mean 'close the last two files'

       [1] [2] [3]
       -> these mean 'shipout pages 1, 2, and 3'

 * Multiline messages -> messages that start at the beginning of a line,
   continue for a few lines and end at the end of a line (the programmer
   explicitly used multiple \write commands, a single \write command
   with embedded newline characters, or single/multiple \message
   commands with leading/trailing newline characters), such as

       Package biblatex Info: Automatic encoding selection.
       (biblatex)             Assuming data encoding 'utf8'.

       *************************************

       **********************
       * No checksum found! *
       **********************
       (from ydoc-doc.sty)

 * "Best-effort" multiline messages -> similar to the previous ones,
   but created using multiple \message commands or a single one with
   embedded newline characters but no leading and/or trailing newline
   characters. They *usually* begin at the beginning of the line and
   end at the end of the line because, as mentioned before, TeX usually
   inserts a line break if the line would not fit otherwise. However,
   that is not always true, especially if max_print_line is large.
   Therefore, sometimes the message may begin in the middle of a line
   and/or the various lines may be strung together or wrapped.
   Examples:

       *****************************************************************

       *****************************************************************
       (from gfssolomos.sty)

       =============== Entering putframe ====================
       \pagegoal =635.97621pt, \pagetotal =368.07768pt.
       (from exam.cls)

 * Error messages -> when an error occurs, TeX usually writes something
   like "! Some error" followed by lines that resemble a stack trace of
   where the error occurred. For example, this input:

       Some text \blah, something else

   would result in

       ! Undefined control sequence.
       l.5 Some text \blah
                          , something else

   With option -file-line-error, the exclamation is replaced by an
   indication like "filename:linenum:".

   The "stack trace" is comprised of pairs of lines. By default, LaTeX
   only shows the last pair (depending on \errorcontextlines) and, when
   there are more lines, they are replaced by a line with " ..." (right
   after the line starting with "!"). In each pair of lines, the first
   one indicates the line content leading up to the error and the
   second one shows the subsequent content. The first line is at most
   half_error_line characters long (default 50) and the second line
   is at most error_line characters long (default 79). The second line
   is indented to start after the end of the first, as in the example
   above. If the content of a line does not fit, a part of it (the
   beginning for the first line and the end for the second line) may
   be replaced by "...". error_line must be < 255 and half_error_line
   must be < error_line -15. If error_line >= max_print_line or
   half_error_line >= max_print_line, TeX does line wrapping as usual
   (see below). If either is exactly max_print_line (which is true
   for the default values), things get confusing, so TeX may add a
   blank line when wrapping.


   LaTeX errors usually follow the format

       ! LaTeX/Package/Class BLAH Error: some description
       See the BLAH documentation for explanation.
       Type H <return> for immediate help.
        ...
       l.5 First error line
                           second error line

   In errorstop mode, such errors are followed by a "?" prompt.

   Finally, runaway arguments have a different format:

       Runaway argument?
       some text\ETC.
       ! SOMETHING ended...

To complicate things, TeX by default wraps (breaks) any line longer
than max_print_line characters (by default, 79). Since some messages
may be output together on a single line, even short messages may be
broken across lines. At the same time, there are quite a few ordinary
lines that in practice happen to be max_print_line characters long,
which makes detecting line wrapping a real challenge. And, just to
make things more interesting, sometimes there is a blank line between
the wrapped line and its continuation line.

pdfTeX (and, I suppose, traditional TeX) counts characters as bytes to
choose where to wrap a line. XeTeX, however, counts utf-8 characters
(I do not know whether that's code points or graphemes), so we need to
take that into consideration.

LuaTeX adds some extra complications: for no apparent reason, it wraps
some lines at max_print_line characters and others at max_print_line +1
characters. It also sometimes "forgets" to wrap a line. And more! It
does not break a line in the middle of a multibyte UTF-8 character.
That is obviously a good idea, but it counts the line length in bytes,
like pdfTeX, which means some lines may be broken at lengths smaller
than max_print_line. While this may seem rare, it can happen when parts
of the document text are included in the log, as is the case with
over/underfull box messages.

So, if at all possible, it is a very good idea to set max_print_line
to a really large value (such as 100,000), effectively disabling line
wrapping. It was useful in the 1980s, but not anymore (your terminal or
editor wraps automatically). Likewise, error_line and half_error_line
should be, respectively, 254 and 238 (more about these values here:
https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/525972).


----------------------
HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS
----------------------

To read this section, pretend for a moment that TeX does not wrap long
lines.

We have a set of handlers, i.e., objects that process specific kinds
of message. Each handler checks if a given line matches some patterns
to decide whether it is supposed to process it (return true) or not
(return false).

There is a loop that, at each iteration, reads a new line from the log
file with moreData() and uses chooseHandler() to call each handler in
turn until one of them processes that line. After the right handler
does its thing, it sends the message to the output, erases this input
line and returns true, which causes the loop to restart, skipping the
remaining handlers.

The loop may behave a little differently in two cases:

 1. If the handler processes just a part of the input line, which may
    happen if the line contains multiple short messages, it removes
    the processed data from the line and leaves the rest. At the next
    iteration, no new data is read: the loop processes the remaining
    material from the same line.

 2. If the handler processes the input and expects specific lines of
    content to follow, it can preset itself as the next handler,
    temporarily bypassing the choice step.

When the line (or part of it) is not recognized by any handler, it is
appended to unrecognizedBuffer. We may sometimes concatenate multiple
text chunks together here because, during processing, we may break the
line into chunks when in fact it comprises a single message. In any
case, we know for sure that the message (or messages) currently in
unrecognizedBuffer is complete when either (1) we identify the next
short message in the line or (2) we proceed to the next input line.
When either happens, we send the buffer to the output.

We know most messages, but not all, start at the beginning of a line.
Therefore, we keep two sets of handlers: beginningOfLineHandlers and
anywhereHandlers. We use the boolean atBeginningOfLine to know when
we may skip trying the beginningOfLineHandlers.

We mentioned that the handler "sends the message to the output". The
handler actually creates a Message object and calls the dispatch()
function to send that object to a coroutine that handles output. The
coroutine aggregates messages by page, generates summaries for some
kinds of message (for example, it may list all undefined references
together) and prints out the report in different formats.

Sometimes we need to be able to check the content of the next line
to decide what to do about the current line (for example, different
messages may begin with a line like "**********"). So, we do not only
read one line from the input at each iteration; instead, we have a
buffer with the next few lines. When the current line has been
completely processed, moreData() simply refills the buffer and calls
Lines:gotoNextLine(), which makes the next line (line 1) become the
current line (line 0), the following line (line 2) become the next
line (line 1) etc.

That would be all if TeX did not wrap long lines, but it does. To unwrap
lines when needed, we (1) check that the line is max_print_lines long;
if so, we (2) check whether the next line is the beginning of a known
message; if it is not, we (3) check whether unwrapping lines makes us
recognize a message that was not identified without unwrapping. Because
of 3, we do this in each of the handlers and not beforehand. To unwrap
a line, we simply join the current line with the next one from the
buffer.

Note that, if you reconfigure the variable max_print_line to a value
larger than 9999 (which is a good thing to do), this program assumes
(quite reasonably) that there is no line wrapping.


------------
THE HANDLERS
------------

We want to be able to explicitly recognize as much messages as possible
(and leave the least amount possible for the unrecognizedBuffer) for at
least three reasons:

 1. A character such as "(", ")", "[", or "]" in an unrecognized message
    may confuse the program (these chars may indicate open/close file
    and begin/end shipout). If it is part of a known message, it will
    not be mistaken for an open/close file etc.

 2. By default, TeX wraps lines longer than max_print_line characters,
    and unwrapping them involves making sure that the following line
    is not the start of a new message. For this to be reliable,
    unknown messages should be kept to a minimum.

 3. We can assign severity levels to known messages; unknown messages
    must always be handled as high-severity, polluting the output.

At each iteration, chooseHandler() calls doit() for every handler. The
handler returns true to signal that chooseHandler() should proceed to
the next iteration. It does that if it did "something" to change the
status for the next iteration:

 * It processed a complete message in this iteration (i.e., the whole
   message was contained in the current line);

 * It processed the message partially and defined nextHandler;

 * It finalized the processing of a previous partial message (i.e., it
   realized the message has ended). This only happens if the handler
   was previously set as nextHandler. When this happens, it sometimes
   does nothing with the content of the current line, only outputs the
   complete message. Still, when the loop restarts, it will no longer
   be the nextHandler (and that is "something").

A handler must provide:

1. A doit() method that returns true or false to indicate whether it
   actually did something with the current line or not.

2. A canDoit(position) method that returns true or false to indicate
   whether the handler can/should process the line given by "position"
   (we use this to identify wrapped lines, as explained later).

3. An init() method to do any necessary setup after the command line
   has been read (it is ok to do nothing). The easiest way to do this
   is to "inherit" from HandlerPrototype.

4. For handlers that deal with messages that can appear in the middle
   of a line, a lookahead(position) method to indicate whether there is
   a message that the handler can/should process in the line indicated
   by "position", even if there is something else in the line before
   that message.

Besides true/false, canDoit() also returns a table with extra data. In
some cases, this table is empty; in others, the handler's doit() method
knows what to do with it. There are two places outside the handler
itself where this data is used:

1. In handleUnrecognizedMessage(), where we call lookahead() and use
   the value of "first" that should be embedded in this table.

2. In Lines:noHandlersForNextLine(), where we treat openParensHandler
   and openSquareBracketHandler specially and read file/page data from
   them.

A simple handler:
-----------------

  exampleHandler = {}
  exampleHandler.pattern = '^%s*L3 programming layer %b<>'

  function exampleHandler:init()
  end

  function exampleHandler:canDoit(position)
      if position == nil then position = 0 end
      local line = Lines:get(position)
      if line == nil then return false, {} end

      local first, last = string.find(line, self.pattern)
      if first == nil then return false
      return true, {first = first, last = last}
  end

  function exampleHandler:doit()
      local myTurn, data = self:canDoit()
      if not myTurn then return false end

      flushUnrecognizedMessages()
      local msg = Message:new()
      msg.severity = DEBUG
      msg.content = string.sub(Lines.current, 1, data.last)
      dispatch(msg)
      Lines:handledChars(data.last)
      return true
  end

  function exampleHandler:lookahead(position)
      local tmp = self.pattern
      self.pattern = string.sub(self.pattern, 2) -- remove leading '^'
      local result, data = self:canDoit()
      self.pattern = tmp
      return result, data
  end

There are two special handlers, which we use as prototypes
(https://www.lua.org/pil/16.1.html ) and derive some other handlers
from:

 - stringsHandler - handles a list of predefined multiline strings
   that may or may not begin at the beginning of a line and may or may
   not end at the end of a line. We identify where the last line of
   the message ends and remove that from the input line, leaving the
   rest for the next handler. In general, the pattern we look for in
   each line should match the whole line and should not end with
   something like ".*", unless we are absolutely sure that (1) each line
   always ends at the end of the line and (2) the line is short enough
   that it is never wrapped (which also implies that the first line
   always starts at the start of the line). This handler is quite
   complex because it has to deal with many different scenarios. We
   derive other handlers from the basic prototype so that we can assign
   different severity levels to each one. Derived handlers differ from
   the prototype only by severity level and the set of patterns to
   search for.

 - genericLatexHandler -> handles the multiline messages generated by
   the \PackageInfo, \ClassWarning etc. LaTeX commands. The handler
   does not need to know in advance the text for all these messages;
   it looks for generic patterns instead and extracts from the message
   itself the name of the package and severity level. It is able to
   identify multiline messages by checking if the following lines are
   prefixed with a specific pattern, so it can also handle messages
   with an unknown number of lines. We derive other handlers from the
   basic prototype because, for each kind of message, we use a different
   set of pattern captures, and we need to treat these differently.
   Derived handlers differ from the prototype by the set of patterns
   to search for and by the unpackData() method, which deals with the
   specific pattern captures.


----------------
UNWRAPPING LINES
----------------

As mentioned, each handler has a canDoit(position) method, where
"position" is the line number in the Lines input buffer (0 is the
current line, 1 is the next line etc.). As expected, doit() calls
canDoit() to check whether it should proceed of not. However, that
is not all: if canDoit() fails to find a match, it checks whether the
line might be a wrapped line. To detect a wrapped line, canDoit()
uses Lines:seemsWrapped() to do three things:

1. Check that the line is the "right" size (in Lines:wrappingLength())

2. Check that the next line is not the beginning of a known message
   (in Lines:noHandlersForNextLine())

3. Check whether unwrapping the line actually gives us something, i.e.,
   the unwrapped line matches something that its two separate parts
   did not.

The problem is in step (2): this entails calling canDoit() from all
handlers on the following line, which means that it may be called many
times and may even call itself on a different line. Therefore, it is
essential that canDoit() have no side effects, i.e., it should not set
any state besides the return values. For the same reason, canDoit()
cannot alter the content of the Lines buffer when it tries to unwrap a
line; it should only use temporary variables instead (not only that:
if unwrapping does not yield a match, we do not want to do it either).

canDoit() may, however, return a "hint" about the line wrapping - either
the text or the pattern that finally matched. Some handlers do that and,
in doit(), take the string or pattern found by canDoit() and unwrap
lines until finding a match to that string or pattern. Others cannot do
this due to various reasons and need to repeat the work already done
by canDoit() (the code is different, however).

Note also that some handlers, such as underOverFullBoxHandler and
genericLatexHandler, cannot do (3), as they do not know in advance
how the end of a given message should look like. The bottom line is,
line unwrapping is done in many different ways according to context.

Finally, this all means that we may call canDoit() from all handlers on
a given line many times. This gets really bad with stringsHandler: for
a sequence of k consecutive lines that are max_print_line long, this
handler alone is O(n^{k+1}), where n is the number of patterns that it
checks for (around 40). A previous implementation proved this to be
impractical, so we work around this problem with memoization.


-----------------------------------------
DETAILS ABOUT UNDER/OVERFULL BOX MESSAGES
-----------------------------------------

These are actually several different messages:

Overfull \[hv]box (Npt too wide) SOMEWHERE
Underfull \[hv]box (badness N) SOMEWHERE

Possible SOMEWHEREs:

1. detected at line N
   -> this is something like a makebox (horizontal) or parbox (vertical)
      with an explicit size argument. For hboxes, this is followed by
      the offending text.

2. has occurred while \output is active
   -> If horizontal, this is probably in a header, footer or something
      similar; if vertical, the vertical glues got too stretched

3. in alignment at lines LINE NUMBERS
   -> the problematic box is part of a tabular or math alignment
      environment. The lines correspond to the whole align structure,
      not only the problematic box. This should only appear as an
      horizontal problem. This is followed by the offending text, but
      it is more often than not just a bunch of "[]" to indicate nested
      boxes

4. in paragraph at lines LINE NUMBERS
   -> "Normal" text. This also only appears as an horizontal problem.
      This is followed by the offending text, which may include a
      few "[]" for whatsits, glues etc. In particular, the text often
      begins with "[]", indicating the left margin glue.

In the log file, all under/overfull box messages are followed by a
description of the boxes involved. This is *not* normally included in
the console output (but it may be, depending on \tracingonline). The
level of detail of this description is controlled by \showboxdepth
and \showboxbreadth. The default for these in LaTeX is -1, which means
this description is omitted and replaced by "[]", so it looks like this:

Underfull \vbox (badness 10000) detected at line 128
 []   <-- this is the description

If the message includes the offending text, the description comes
after it:

Underfull \hbox (badness 3417) in paragraph at lines 128--128
 []\T1/LibertinusSerif-TLF/b/n/14.4 (+20) Some document text...
 []   <-- this is the description

If there is no offending text, the description may appear in the same
line as the under/overfull box message (both are \message's). The
offending text, if any, always starts at the beginning of a line and
ends at the end of a line.

About the description: https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/367589

This all means that handling these messages from a pipe is different
than from the log file, because in the log file you know there will
be a "[]" after the message. What we do here is check whether that
string is there; if it is, we remove it.

under/overfull messages that do not include the offending text are
\message's and, therefore, there may be extra text (such as a shipout)
on the same line.

Usage: texlogsieve [OPTION]... [INPUT FILE]
texlogsieve reads a LaTeX log file (or the standard input), filters
out less relevant messages, and displays a summary report.

texlogsieve reads additional options from the texlogsieverc file
if it exists anywhere in the TeX path (for example, in the current
directory).

Options:
  --page-delay, --no-page-delay          enable/disable grouping
                                         messages by page before display
  --summary, --no-summary                enable/disable final summary
  --only-summary                         no filtering, only final summary
  --shipouts, --no-shipouts              enable/disable reporting shipouts
  --file-banner, --no-file-banner        Show/suppress "From file ..." banners
  --repetitions, --no-repetitions        allow/prevent repeated messages
  --be-redundant, --no-be-redundant      present/suppress ordinary messages
                                         that will also appear in the summary
  --box-detail, --no-box-detail          include/exclude full under/overfull

-- stringsHandler
--
-- This is the most complex handler. It deals with predefined strings that
-- may span multiple lines. The message may start anywhere on the line (this
-- handler can be in anywhereHandlers) and may end before the end of the
-- line. In fact, depending on max_print_line, it is even possible that the
-- many lines of the message are concatenated in a single line in the log
-- or, conversely, that some lines are wrapped. So, for example, the
-- developer may have envisioned a message like
--
-- ********************
-- *    Hi there!     *
-- ********************
--
-- but this might turn to
--
-- ******************** *    Hi there!     * ********************
--
-- or
--
-- ******************
-- **
-- *    Hi there!    
--  *
-- ******************
-- **
--
-- or even
--
-- ******************
-- ** *    Hi there! 
--     * ************
-- ********
--
-- So, what we do here is to consider every line in the search pattern as a
-- segment of the message that may start in the middle of a line and/or may
-- be wrapped at the end of the line. We match each of these segments in
-- turn. Because of that, the patterns should completely match all lines in
-- the message, not just the beginning of the line followed by ".*" or ".+".
--
-- Still, if you know that a specific message or line (1) always starts
-- at the beginning of the line, (2) never gets wrapped, and (3) is never
-- followed by another message in the same line, then you can match just
-- the beginning of the line and use ".*" for the rest. There are a few
-- messages below defined like this.
--
-- Note that, when the handler is executed, the pattern *is* at the beginning
-- of the current line (in some cases, with leading spaces) because, if there
-- was any leading text originally in the line, some previous handler has
-- already removed it. This is why we can (and should!) anchor the pattern
-- with "^%s*". As before, if you do know that the line always starts at the
-- beginning of a line, you may instead anchor the pattern with "^". Either
-- way, we assume we cannot know the true length of the line, so it may be
-- wrapped at any point. Also, do not forget about lookahead(), which removes
-- the "^" anchor.

-- utf8FontMapHandler

-- This handles the encoding-related multi-line messages generated by
-- inputenc/fontenc with pdftex and utf8, similar to:
--
--   Now handling font encoding LS1 ...
--   ... no UTF-8 mapping file for font encoding LS1
--
-- or
--
--   Now handling font encoding LY1 ...
--   ... processing UTF-8 mapping file for font encoding LY1
--      defining Unicode char U+00A0 (decimal 160)
--
-- We could handle these by inheriting from genericLatexHandler, which
-- might be a good idea as this handler is quite complex. Still, the
-- advantage of this handler is that it groups the first lines (that
-- indicate the encoding) and the continuation lines as a unit, even
-- though there are other messages in between that are handled by other
-- handlers. We use two strategies to deal with continuation lines to
-- accomplish this:
--
--  1. After the first line, we change the self.doit method and define
--     ourselves as nextHandler, because we know the next line "belongs"
--     to us (nothing new here, genericLatexHandler does this too)
--
--  2. After the second line, we do not know whether the next line "belongs"
--     to us (actually, it most likely does not). So, we just change the
--     self.doit method and wait to be called by chooseHandler() again a
--     few lines down the road. When one of the patterns we are looking for
--     matches, we are back in business. This is why handleOtherLines must
--     check for the base "Now handling font encoding" pattern too: there
--     might not be continuation lines and we need to handle a new message
--     instead at some other point in the input file.

To find the full path of a file in the TeX search path, we may use

thepath = kpse.find_file("article")
thepath = kpse.find_file("/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls")
thepath = kpse.find_file("latex/base/article.cls")
thepath = kpse.find_file("texmf.cnf", "cnf")

The filename may or may not include the extension; kpathsea adds the
extension if necessary according to the specified format (default is
"tex", which means extensions .tex, .sty, .cls and some others). This
is problematic, because (1) it does not recognize filenames with an
unknown extension and (2) if there is a file named "what.ever.tex" and
another one called "what.ever", it may find the wrong file.

We want to check whether a string from the log file corresponds to the
complete path of an existing filename, which means we already know the
extension. Therefore, we will use the type "other text files". This
prevents kpathsea from adding the extension automatically (which is what
we want) and also prevents kpathsea from searching the standard TeX path,
which is also nice because we are checking a complete path.
