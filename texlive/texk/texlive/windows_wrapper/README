This README file and the graphics are public domain.

This directory is for the generic TeX Live wrapper on Windows that is
used for most scripts. The main file is runscript.tlu.

runscript.exe/dll are copied here from the runtime (bin/windows) because
../linked_scripts/Makefile[.am] installs them on Windows.

*.svg are the sources for *.ico,
and the *.ico are used in wrappers. Hence their locaton here.

>From Siep:

In this directory also are the icons and their sources for the GUI wrappers.

The dviout- and TeXworks files are available from their source
distributions.  tlcockpit.xcf is included in the tlcockpit package.
epspdf.svg is in the epspdf package, under the name of logo.svg.
The bitmap2eps-, tlmgr- and, psviewer icons- and svg files are by me and
are only here.

How I created and added the icons:

The GIMP can be used to export the usual bitmap formats and .svg to
icons. Naturally, it can also export .xcf, its own native format, to
icons. It can even import .ico files, at least in the case of
dviout.ico. So I consider dviout.ico its own source. In practice, I
also used IcoFX, a windows utility.

All icons are 256x256 pixels, which windows will resize
as needed. Only dviout.ico is 128x128.

Normally, icons are added during compilation. But for the 2023
release, Akira Kakuto already provided the [w]runscript binaries
along with the bulk of TL binaries. Therefore I opted for adding
icons after the fact.  This can be done with ResourceHacker
(http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/), even from the command-line:

rename name.exe name-bk.exe
rem create a resource script:
echo 1 ICON name.ico >name.rc
rem turn resource script plus icon into a binary resource:
ResourceHacker -open name.rc -save name.res -action compile
rem add resource to binary:
ResourceHacker -open name-bk.exe -save name.exe -action add -res name.res
