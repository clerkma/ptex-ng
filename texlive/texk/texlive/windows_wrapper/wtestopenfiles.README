This program can be used to prevent doomed TeX Live update attempts
on windows by testing whether all files concerned can be opened with
exclusive read/write access.

It reads a list of absolute filepaths from stdin and errors out if
any of them cannot be opened with exclusive read/write access.

A -v option also produces status output on stdout.

Cross-compiling under linux:

  i686-w64-mingw32-strip wtestopenfiles.exe
