.SH DESCRIPTION
updmap version r65932 (2023\-02\-19 21:49:48 +0100)
.PP
Update the default font map files used by pdftex and dvipdfm(x)
(pdftex.map), dvips (psfonts.map), and optionally pxdvi, as determined
by all configuration files updmap.cfg (usually the ones returned by
running "kpsewhich \fB\-\-all\fR updmap.cfg", but see below).
.PP
Among other things, these map files are used to determine which fonts
should be used as bitmaps and which as outlines, and to determine which
font files are included, typically subsetted, in the PDF or PostScript output.
.PP
updmap\-sys (or updmap \fB\-sys\fR) is intended to affect the system\-wide
configuration, while updmap\-user (or updmap \fB\-user\fR) affects personal
configuration files only, overriding the system files.
.PP
As a consequence, once updmap\-user has been run, even a single time,
running updmap\-sys no longer has any effect.  updmap\-sys issues a
warning about this, since it is rarely desirable.
See https://tug.org/texlive/scripts\-sys\-user.html for details.
.PP
By default, the TeX filename database (ls\-R) is also updated.
.PP
The updmap system is regrettably complicated, for both inherent and
historical reasons.  A general overview:
.PP
\- updmap.cfg files are mainly about listing other files, namely the
.IP
font\-specific .maps, in which each line gives information about a
different TeX (.tfm) font.
.PP
\- updmap reads the updmap.cfg files and then concatenates the
.IP
contents of those .map files into the main output files: psfonts.map
for dvips and pdftex.map for pdftex and dvipdfmx.
.PP
\- The updmap.cfg files themselves are created and updated at package
.IP
installation time, by the system installer or the package manager or
by hand, and not (by default) by updmap.

The main output:
.IP
The main output of updmap is the files containing the individual font
map lines which the drivers (dvips, pdftex, etc.) read to handle fonts.
.IP
The map files for dvips (psfonts.map) and pdftex and dvipdfmx
(pdftex.map) are written to TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/updmap/{dvips,pdftex}/.
.IP
In addition, information about Kanji fonts is written to
TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/updmap/dvipdfmx/kanjix.map, and optionally to
TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/updmap/pxdvi/xdvi\-ptex.map.  These are for Kanji
only and are not like other map files.  dvipdfmx reads pdftex.map for
the map entries for non\-Kanji fonts.
.IP
If no option is given, so the invocation is just "updmap\-user" or
"updmap\-sys", these output files are always recreated.
.IP
Otherwise, if an option such as \fB\-\-enable\fR or \fB\-\-disable\fR is given, the
output files are recreated if the list of enabled map files (from
updmap.cfg) has changed.  The \fB\-\-force\fR option overrides this,
always recreating the output files.
.PP
Explanation of the map types:
.IP
The normal type is Map.
.IP
The only difference between Map and MixedMap is that MixedMap entries
are not added to psfonts_pk.map.  The purpose is to help users with
devices that render Type 1 outline fonts worse than mode\-tuned Type 3
bitmap fonts.  So, MixedMap is used for fonts that are available as
both Type 1 and Metafont.
.IP
KanjiMap entries are added to psfonts_t1.map and kanjix.map.
.PP
Explanation of the OPTION names for \fB\-\-showoptions\fR, \fB\-\-showoption\fR, \fB\-\-setoption\fR:
.TP
dvipsPreferOutline
true,false  (default true)
.IP
Whether dvips uses bitmaps or outlines, when both are available.
.TP
dvipsDownloadBase35
true,false  (default true)
.IP
Whether dvips includes the standard 35 PostScript fonts in its output.
.TP
pdftexDownloadBase14
true,false   (default true)
.IP
Whether pdftex includes the standard 14 PDF fonts in its output.
.TP
pxdviUse
true,false  (default false)
.IP
Whether maps for pxdvi (Japanese\-patched xdvi) are under updmap's control.
.TP
jaEmbed
(any string)
.TP
jaVariant
(any string)
.TP
scEmbed
(any string)
.TP
tcEmbed
(any string)
.TP
koEmbed
(any string)
.IP
See below.
.TP
LW35
URWkb,URW,ADOBEkb,ADOBE  (default URWkb)
.IP
Adapt the font and file names of the standard 35 PostScript fonts.
.nf
.TP
URWkb
URW fonts with "berry" filenames    (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)
.TP
URW
URW fonts with "vendor" filenames   (e.g. n019064l.pfb)
.fi
.TP
ADOBEkb
Adobe fonts with "berry" filenames  (e.g. phvbo8an.pfb)
.TP
ADOBE
Adobe fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. hvnbo___.pfb)
.fi
.IP
These options are only read and acted on by updmap; dvips, pdftex, etc.,
do not know anything about them.  They work by changing the default map
file which the programs read, so they can be overridden by specifying
command\-line options or configuration files to the programs, as
explained at the beginning of updmap.cfg.
.IP
The options jaEmbed and jaVariant (formerly kanjiEmbed and kanjiVariant)
specify special replacements in the map lines.  If a map contains the
string @jaEmbed@, then this will be replaced by the value of that option;
similarly for jaVariant.  In this way, users of Japanese TeX can select
different fonts to be included in the final output.  The counterpart for
Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Korean fonts are
scEmbed, tcEmbed and koEmbed respectively.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
Explanation of trees and files normally used:
.IP
If \fB\-\-cnffile\fR is specified on the command line (can be given multiple
times), its value(s) is(are) used.  Otherwise, updmap reads all the
updmap.cfg files found by running `kpsewhich \fB\-all\fR updmap.cfg',
in the order returned by kpsewhich (which is the order of trees
defined in texmf.cnf).
.IP
In either case, if multiple updmap.cfg files are found, all the maps
mentioned in all the updmap.cfg files are merged.
.IP
Thus, if updmap.cfg files are present in all trees, and the default
layout is used as shipped with TeX Live, the following files are
read, in the given order.
.nf
.IP
For updmap\-sys:
TEXMFSYSCONFIG \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-config/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
TEXMFSYSVAR    \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-var/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
TEXMFLOCAL     \fI\,$TEXLIVE/texmf\-local/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
TEXMFDIST      \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
.IP
For updmap\-user:
TEXMFCONFIG    $HOME/.texliveYYYY/texmf\-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
TEXMFVAR       $HOME/.texliveYYYY/texmf\-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
TEXMFHOME      \fI\,$HOME/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
TEXMFSYSCONFIG \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-config/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
TEXMFSYSVAR    \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-var/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
TEXMFLOCAL     \fI\,$TEXLIVE/texmf\-local/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
TEXMFDIST      \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
.IP
(where YYYY is the TeX Live release version).
.fi
.IP
According to the actions, updmap might write to one of the given files
or create a new updmap.cfg, described further below.
.PP
Where and which updmap.cfg changes are saved:
.IP
When no options are given, the updmap.cfg file(s) are only read, not
written.  It's when an option \fB\-\-setoption\fR, \fB\-\-enable\fR or \fB\-\-disable\fR is
specified that an updmap.cfg needs to be updated.  In this case:
.IP
1) If config files are given on the command line, then the first one
given is used to save any such changes.
.IP
2) If the config files are taken from kpsewhich output, then the
algorithm is more complex:
.IP
2a) If \fI\,$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP or \fI\,$TEXMFHOME/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP
appears in the list of used files, then the one listed first by
kpsewhich \fB\-\-all\fR (equivalently, the one returned by kpsewhich
updmap.cfg), is used.
.IP
2b) If neither of the above two are present and changes are made, a
new config file is created in \fI\,$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP.
.IP
In general, the idea is that if the user cannot write to a given
config file, a higher\-level one can be used.  That way, the
distribution's settings can be overridden system\-wide using
TEXMFLOCAL, and system settings can be overridden again in a
particular user's TEXMFHOME or TEXMFCONFIG.
.PP
Resolving multiple definitions of a font:
.IP
If a font is defined in more than one map file, then the definition
coming from the first\-listed updmap.cfg is used.  If a font is
defined multiple times within the same map file, one is chosen
arbitrarily.  In both cases a warning is issued.
.PP
Disabling maps:
.IP
updmap.cfg files with higher priority (listed earlier) can disable
maps mentioned in lower priority (listed later) updmap.cfg files by
writing, e.g.,
.IP
#! Map mapname.map
.IP
or
.IP
#! MixedMap mapname.map
.TP
in the higher\-priority updmap.cfg file.
(The #! must be at the
.IP
beginning of the line, with at least one space or tab afterward, and
whitespace between each word on the list.)
.IP
As an example, suppose you have a copy of MathTime Pro fonts
and want to disable the Belleek version of the fonts; that is,
disable the map belleek.map.  You can create the file
\fI\,$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg\/\fP with the content
.IP
#! Map belleek.map
Map mt\-plus.map
Map mt\-yy.map
.IP
and call updmap.
.PP
Listing of maps:
.IP
The two options \fB\-\-listmaps\fR and \fB\-\-listavailablemaps\fR list all maps
defined in any of the updmap.cfg files (for \fB\-\-listmaps\fR), and
only those actually found on the system (for \fB\-\-listavailablemaps\fR).
The output format is one line per font map, with the following
fields separated by tabs: map, type (Map, MixedMap, KanjiMap),
status (enabled, disabled), origin (the updmap.cfg file where
it is mentioned, or 'builtin' for the three basic maps).
.IP
In the case of \fB\-\-listmaps\fR there can be one additional fields
(again separated by tab) containing '(not available)' for those
map files that cannot be found.
.PP
updmap\-user vs. updmap\-sys:
.IP
When updmap\-sys is run, TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR are used
instead of TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR, respectively.  This is the
primary difference between updmap\-sys and updmap\-user.
.IP
Other locations may be used if you give them on the command line, or
these trees don't exist, or you are not using the original TeX Live.
.PP
To see the precise locations of the various files that
will be read and written, give the \fB\-n\fR option (or read the source).
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The log file is written to TEXMFVAR/web2c/updmap.log.
