.SH DESCRIPTION
fmtutil version r60154 (2021\-08\-03 23:55:56 +0200)
.PP
Rebuild and manage TeX fmts and Metafont bases, collectively called
"formats" here. (MetaPost no longer uses the past\-equivalent "mems".)
.PP
If not operating in mktexfmt mode, exactly one command must be given,
filename suffixes should generally not be specified, no non\-option
arguments are allowed, and multiple formats can be generated.
.PP
If the command name ends in mktexfmt, only one format can be created.
The only options supported are \fB\-\-help\fR and \fB\-\-version\fR, and the command
line must be either a format name, with extension, or a plain name that
is passed as the argument to \fB\-\-byfmt\fR (see below).  The full name of the
generated file (if any) is written to stdout, and nothing else.  The
system directories are used if they are writable, else the user directories.
.PP
By default, the return status is zero if all formats requested are
successfully built, else nonzero.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
Explanation of trees and files normally used:
.IP
If \fB\-\-cnffile\fR is specified on the command line (possibly multiple
times), its value(s) are used.  Otherwise, fmtutil reads all the
fmtutil.cnf files found by running "kpsewhich \fB\-all\fR fmtutil.cnf", in the
order returned by kpsewhich.  Files specified via \fB\-\-cnffile\fR are
first tried to be loaded directly, and if not found and the file names
don't contain directory parts, are searched via kpsewhich.
.IP
In any case, if multiple fmtutil.cnf files are found, all the format
definitions found in all the fmtutil.cnf files are merged.
.IP
Thus, if fmtutil.cnf files are present in all trees, and the default
layout is used as shipped with TeX Live, the following files are
read, in the given order.
.nf
.IP
For fmtutil\-sys:
TEXMFSYSCONFIG \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP
TEXMFSYSVAR    \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP
TEXMFLOCAL     \fI\,$TEXLIVE/texmf\-local/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP
TEXMFDIST      \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP
.IP
For fmtutil\-user:
TEXMFCONFIG    $HOME/.texliveYYYY/texmf\-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
TEXMFVAR       $HOME/.texliveYYYY/texmf\-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
TEXMFHOME      \fI\,$HOME/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP
TEXMFSYSCONFIG \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP
TEXMFSYSVAR    \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP
TEXMFLOCAL     \fI\,$TEXLIVE/texmf\-local/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP
TEXMFDIST      \fI\,$TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf\-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP
.IP
(where YYYY is the TeX Live release version).
.fi
.IP
According to the actions, fmtutil might update one of the existing cnf
files or create a new fmtutil.cnf, as described below.
.PP
Where format files are written:
.IP
By default, format files are (re)written in \fI\,$TEXMFSYSVAR/ENGINE\/\fP by
fmtutil\-sys, and \fI\,$TEXMFVAR/ENGINE\/\fP by fmtutil\-user, where \fI\,/ENGINE\/\fP is
a subdirectory named for the engine used, such as "pdftex".
.IP
For mktexfmt, TEXMFSYSVAR is used if it is writable, else TEXMFVAR.
.IP
If the \fB\-\-fmtdir\fR=\fI\,DIR\/\fR option is specified, DIR is used instead of
TEXMF[SYS]VAR, but the \fI\,/ENGINE\/\fP subdir is still used by default.
.IP
In all cases, if the \fB\-\-no\-engine\-subdir\fR option is specified, the
\fI\,/ENGINE\/\fP subdir is omitted.
.PP
Where configuration changes are saved:
.IP
If config files are given on the command line, then the first one
given will be used to save any changes from \fB\-\-enable\fR or \fB\-\-disable\fR.
.IP
If the config files are taken from kpsewhich output, then the
algorithm is more complicated:
.IP
1) If \fI\,$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP or
\fI\,$TEXMFHOME/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP appears in the list of used files,
then the one listed first by kpsewhich \fB\-\-all\fR (equivalently, the one
returned by "kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf"), is used.
.IP
2) If neither of the above two are present and changes are made, a
new config file is created in \fI\,$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP.
.IP
In general, the idea is that if a given config file is not writable, a
higher\-level one can be used.  That way, the distribution's settings
can be overridden system\-wide using TEXMFLOCAL, and system settings
can be overridden again in a particular user's TEXMFHOME or TEXMFCONF.
.PP
Resolving multiple definitions of a format:
.IP
If a format is defined in more than one config file, then the definition
coming from the first\-listed fmtutil.cnf is used.
.PP
Disabling formats:
.IP
fmtutil.cnf files with higher priority (listed earlier) can disable
formats in lower priority (listed later) fmtutil.cnf files by
writing a line like this in the higher\-priority fmtutil.cnf file:
.IP
#! <fmtname> <enginename> <hyphen> <args>
.IP
The #! must be at the beginning of the line, with at least one space
or tab afterward, and there must be whitespace between each word on
the list.
.IP
For example, you can disable the luajitlatex format by creating
the file \fI\,$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\/\fP with the line
.IP
#! luajitlatex luajittex language.dat,language.dat.lua lualatex.ini
.IP
(As it happens, the luajittex\-related formats are precisely why the
\fB\-\-no\-error\-if\-no\-engine\fR option exists, since luajittex cannot be
compiled on all platforms. So this is not needed.)
.PP
fmtutil\-user (fmtutil \fB\-user\fR) vs. fmtutil\-sys (fmtutil \fB\-sys\fR):
.IP
When fmtutil\-sys is run or the command line option \fB\-sys\fR is used,
TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR are used instead of TEXMFCONFIG and
TEXMFVAR, respectively. This is the primary difference between
fmtutil\-sys and fmtutil\-user.
.IP
See https://tug.org/texlive/scripts\-sys\-user.html for details.
.IP
Other locations may be used if you give them on the command line, or
these trees don't exist, or you are not using the original TeX Live.
.PP
Supporting development binaries:
.IP
If an engine name ends with "\-dev", formats are created in
the respective directory with the \fB\-dev\fR stripped.  This allows for
easily running development binaries in parallel with the released
binaries.
