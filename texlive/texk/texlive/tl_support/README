Public domain.

This directory mostly contains documentation for scripts which are maintained
as part of TeX Live. The scripts themselves are maintained under Master:
Master/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/
Master/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive-extra

In addition, the tcfmgr script and tcfmgr.map file, which are installed
under texmf-dist/texconfig and only used by texconfig, are here.

And there is a copy of fmtutil.cnf, for the sake of the run-texlinks target.
(It is kept in sync manually, via Master/tlpkg/dev/srclist.txt.)
