.SH NAME
pdftex \- PDF output from TeX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdftex
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ \fB&\fPformat ]
.RI [ file | \fB\e\fPcommands ]
.\"=====================================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run the pdf\*(TX typesetter on
.IR file ,
usually creating
.IR file.pdf .
If the file argument has no extension, ".tex" will be appended to it. 
Instead of a filename, a set of pdf\*(TX commands can be given, the first
of which must start with a backslash.
With a 
.BI & format
argument pdf\*(TX uses a different set of precompiled commands,
contained in
.IR format\fB.fmt\fP ;
it is usually better to use the
.B -fmt
.I format
option instead.
.PP
pdf\*(TX is a version of \*(TX, with the e-\*(TX extensions, that can
create PDF files as well as DVI files.
.PP
In DVI mode, pdf\*(TX can be used as a complete replacement for the
\*(TX engine.
.PP
The typical use of pdf\*(TX is with a pregenerated formats for which
PDF output has been enabled.  The
.B pdftex
command uses the equivalent of the plain \*(TX format, and the
.B pdflatex
command uses the equivalent of the \*(LX format.
To generate formats, use the
.B -ini
switch.
.PP
The
.B pdfinitex
and
.B pdfvirtex
commands are pdf\*(TX's analogues to the
.B initex
and
.B virtex
commands.  In this installation, if the links exist, they are symbolic
links to the
.B pdftex
executable.
.PP
In PDF mode, pdf\*(TX can natively handle the
.IR PDF ,
.IR JPG ,
.IR JBIG2 ,
and
.I PNG
graphics formats.  pdf\*(TX cannot include PostScript or Encapsulated
PostScript (EPS) graphics files; first convert them to PDF using 
.BR epstopdf (1).
pdf\*(TX's handling of its command-line arguments is similar to that
of the other \*(TX programs in the
.I web2c
implementation.
.PP
Starting with version 1.40, pdf\*(TX incorporates the e-\*(TX
extensions, and pdfe\*(TX is just a copy of pdf\*(TX.  See 
.BR etex (1).
.\"=====================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
This version of pdf\*(TX understands the following command line options.
.TP
.BI -cnf-line \ string
Parse
.I string
as a
.I texmf.cnf
configuration line.  See the Kpathsea manual.
.TP
.B -draftmode
Sets \epdfdraftmode so pdf\*(TX doesn't write a PDF and doesn't read any
included images, thus speeding up execution.
.TP
.B -enc
Enable the enc\*(TX extensions.  This option is only effective in
combination with
.BR -ini .
For documentation of the enc\*(TX extensions see
http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html.
.TP
.B -etex
Enable the e-\*(TX extensions.  This option is only effective in
combination with
.BR -ini .
See
.BR etex (1).
.TP
.B -file-line-error
Print error messages in the form
.I file:line:error
which is similar to the way many compilers format them.
.TP
.B -no-file-line-error
Disable printing error messages in the
.I file:line:error
style.
.TP
.B -file-line-error-style
This is the old name of the
.B -file-line-error
option.
.TP
.BI -fmt \ format
Use
.I format
as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which
pdf\*(TX was called or a
.I %&
line.
.TP
.B -halt-on-error
Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during processing.
.TP
.B -help
Print help message and exit.
.TP
.B -ini
Start in
.I INI
mode, which is used to dump formats.  The
.I INI
mode can be used for typesetting, but no format is preloaded, and
basic initializations like setting catcodes may be required.
.TP
.BI -interaction \ mode
Sets the interaction mode.  The mode can be either
.IR batchmode ,
.IR nonstopmode ,
.IR scrollmode ,
and
.IR errorstopmode .
The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding
\ecommands.
.TP
.B -ipc
Send DVI or PDF output to a socket as well as the usual output file.
Whether this option is available is the choice of the installer.
.TP
.B -ipc-start
As
.BR -ipc ,
and starts the server at the other end as well.  Whether this option
is available is the choice of the installer.
.TP
.BI -jobname \ name
Use
.I name
for the job name, instead of deriving it from the name of the input file.
.TP
.BI -kpathsea-debug \ bitmask
Sets path searching debugging flags according to the bitmask.  See the
.I Kpathsea
manual for details.
.TP
.BI -mktex \ fmt
Enable
.RI mktex fmt ,
where
.I fmt
must be either
.I tex
or
.IR tfm .
.TP
.B -mltex
Enable ML\*(TX extensions.  Only effective in combination with
.BR -ini .
.TP
.BI -no-mktex \ fmt
Disable
.RI mktex fmt ,
where
.I fmt
must be either
.I tex
or
.IR tfm .
.TP
.BI -output-comment \ string
In DVI mode, use
.I string
for the DVI file comment instead of the date. This option is ignored in
PDF mode.
.TP
.BI -output-directory \ directory
Write output files in
.I directory
instead of the current directory.  Look up input files in
.I directory
first, then along the normal search path.
.TP
.BI -output-format \ format
Set the output format mode, where
.I format
must be either
.I pdf
or
.IR dvi .
This also influences the set of graphics formats understood by pdf\*(TX.
.TP
.B -parse-first-line
If the first line of the main input file begins with
.I %&
parse it to look for a dump name or a
.B -translate-file
option.
.TP
.B -no-parse-first-line
Disable parsing of the first line of the main input file.
.TP
.BI -progname \ name
Pretend to be program
.IR name .
This affects both the format used and the search paths.
.TP
.B -recorder
Enable the filename recorder.
This leaves a trace of the files opened for input and output
in a file with extension
.IR .fls .
.TP
.B -shell-escape
Enable the
.RI \ewrite18{ command }
construct.  The
.I command
can be any shell command.  This construct is normally
disallowed for security reasons.
.TP
.B -no-shell-escape
Disable the
.RI \ewrite18{ command }
construct, even if it is enabled in the
.I texmf.cnf
file.
.TP
.B -shell-restricted
Enable restricted \ewrite18{}, as explained in the ``Shell escapes''
section of the Web2c Texinfo manual.
.TP
.B -src-specials
In DVI mode, insert source specials into the DVI file. This option is
ignored in PDF mode.
.TP
.BI -src-specials \ where
In DVI mode, insert source specials in certain places of the DVI file. The
.I where
argument is a comma-separated value list:
.IR cr ,
.IR display ,
.IR hbox ,
.IR math ,
.IR par ,
.IR parent ,
or
.IR vbox .
This option is ignored in PDF mode.
.TP
.BI -synctex \ NUMBER
generate SyncTeX data for previewers according to bits of NUMBER. See the
.I synctex
manual page for details.
.TP
.BI -translate-file \ tcxname
Use the
.I tcxname
translation table to set the mapping of input characters and
re-mapping of output characters.
.TP
.BI -default-translate-file \ tcxname
Like
.B -translate-file
except that a
.I %&
line can overrule this setting.
.TP
.B -version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.B -8bit
make all characters printable by default.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH ENVIRONMENT
See the Kpathsea library documentation (e.g., the `Path specifications'
node) for precise details of how the environment variables are used.
The
.B kpsewhich
utility can be used to query the values of the variables.
.PP
One caveat: In most pdf\*(TX formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you
give directly to pdf\*(TX, because ~ is an active character in \*(TX,
and hence is expanded, not taken as part of the filename. Other
programs, such as \*(MF, do not have this problem.
.PP
.TP
.B TEXMFOUTPUT
Normally, pdf\*(TX puts its output files in the current directory.  If
any output file cannot be opened there, it tries to open it in the
directory specified in the environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT.
There is no default value for that variable.  For example, if you say
.I pdftex paper
and the current directory is not writable and TEXMFOUTPUT has
the value
.IR /tmp ,
pdf\*(TX attempts to create
.I /tmp/paper.log
(and
.IR /tmp/paper.pdf ,
if any output is produced.)  TEXMFOUTPUT is also checked for input
files, as \*(TX often generates files that need to be subsequently
read; for input, no suffixes (such as ``.tex'') are added by default,
the input name is simply checked as given.
.TP
.B TEXINPUTS
Search path for
.I \einput
and
.I \eopenin
files.
This normally starts with ``.'', so
that user files are found before system files.  An empty path
component will be replaced with the paths defined in the
.I texmf.cnf
file.  For example, set TEXINPUTS to ".:/home/user/tex:" to prepend the
current directory and ``/home/user/tex'' to the standard search path.
.TP
.B TEXFORMATS
Search path for format files.
.TP
.B TEXEDIT
Command template for switching to editor.  The default, usually
.BR vi ,
is set when pdf\*(TX is compiled.
.TP
.B TFMFONTS
Search path for font metric
.RI ( .tfm )
files.
.TP
.B SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
If set, its value, taken to be in epoch-seconds, will be used for the
timestamps in the PDF output, such as the CreationDate and ModDate keys.
This is useful for making reproducible builds.
.TP
.B FORCE_SOURCE_DATE
If set to the value "1", the time-related \*(TX primitives
.RI ( \eyear ,
.IR \emonth ,
.IR \eday ,
.IR \etime )
are also initialized from the value of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.  This is not
recommended if there is any viable alternative.
.br
pdf\*(TX also has several primitives to support reproducible builds,
which are preferable to setting these environment variables; see the
main manual.
.PP
Many, many more environment variables may be consulted related to path
searching.  See the Kpathsea manual.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH FILES
The location of the files mentioned below varies from system to
system.  Use the
.B kpsewhich
utility to find their locations.
.TP
.I pdftex.map
Font name mapping definitions.
.TP
.I *.tfm
Metric files for pdf\*(TX's fonts.
.TP
.I *.fmt
Predigested pdf\*(TX format (.\|fmt) files.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH NOTES
.\"=====================================================================
.SH BUGS
This version of pdf\*(TX fails to trap arithmetic overflow when
dimensions are added or subtracted.  Cases where this occurs are rare,
but when it does the generated
DVI or PDF file will be invalid.

\*(TX was designed by Donald E. Knuth,
who implemented it using his \*(WB system for Pascal programs.
It was ported to Unix at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and
at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.
The version now offered with the Unix \*(TX distribution is that
generated by the \*(WB to C system
.RB ( web2c ),
originally written by Tomas Rokicki and Tim Morgan.
The enc\*(TX extensions were written by Petr Olsak.
