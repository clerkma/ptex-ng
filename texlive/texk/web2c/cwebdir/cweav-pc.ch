This is the change file for CWEB's CWEAVE under DOS
(Contributed by Lee Wittenberg, March 1993)
(Also includes workaround for compiler bug, November 1993,
 contributed by Jorge Fernandez Arnaiz -- arnaiz@redvax1.dgsca.unam.mx)

Changes necessary for compiling with Borland C/C++
Use compilation switches -mc -w-pro -Ff=5000

Note: The changes to section 4 are not necessary if using a compiler
that allows >64K arrays. (If you need lots more bytes, try the alternate
change files that have -bs in their name instead of -pc.)
