The file cwebman.tex is the user manual.
The examples directory contains additional examples of the use of CWEB.
The files common.c and ctangle.c are used for bootstrapping.
The file cweb.1 is a manual page.
The file cweb.el is suggested for GNU-Emacs users.
The files c++lib.w and iso_types.w are for C++ users (say `@i c++lib.w'
and/or `@i iso_types.w' at beginning of program).
The files *-man.ch are used if you want to make the full 243-page CWEB manual.
The files *-bs.ch are used instead of *-pc.ch if you are doing BIG programs.
You can use makefile.bs to make CWEB with *-bs.ch.
The files *-ql.ch are for QDOS/SMSQ systems; see readme.ql for further info.
The files *-w32.ch use __fastcall conventions on win32 systems.
The file comm-mac.ch is for Macintosh conventions.
The other files named *.ch are sample change files for local customization.

IMPORTANT: Please touch *.c before proceeding.
Then edit the opening lines of Makefile so that it has the proper
directory information for your local system.

To make ctangle and cweave say `make all'; this should produce roughly
the following actions (possibly with harmless warning messages from cc):

cc -g -w -c ctangle.c
cc -g -w -DCWEBINPUTS=\"/usr/local/lib/cweb\" -c common.c
cc -g -o ctangle ctangle.o common.o 
./ctangle cweave
cc -g -w -c cweave.c
cc -g -w -o cweave cweave.o common.o

To get some reassurance that things are OK, you can say `make cautiously',
which ensures that CTANGLE will reproduce itself. (Otherwise the source
files common.w and ctangle.w won't actually have been used.)

To install cweave and ctangle say `make install'. You probably need to
be superuser to do this; but it's wise to `make all' first, BEFORE
becoming superuser and saying `make install'.

Note that change files for VMS, AMIGA, MAC, and PCs are provided.  When you
are first bootstrapping to a new system, you may need to edit common.c and
ctangle.c by hand, but the vast majority of the change-file changes are
minor refinements that are not necessary for a rudimentary ctangle.
