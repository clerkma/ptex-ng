For use on QDOS/SMSQ systems the variable |max_file_name_length| is shortened
to 42 characters, i.e. 5 characters for the device name, 36 characters
for the file name plus one character as string terminator. (Note that
(current) QDOS/SMSQ file systems have a limitation of 36 characters as
maximum length for a file name.

@ We now must look at the command line arguments and set the file names
accordingly.  At least one file name must be present: the \.{CWEB}
file.  It may have an extension, or it may omit the extension to get |".w"| or
|".web"| added.  The \TEX/ output file name is formed by replacing the \.{CWEB}
file name extension by |".tex"|, and the \CEE/ file name by replacing
the extension by |".c"|, after removing the directory name (if any).

If there is a second file name present among the arguments, it is the
change file, again either with an extension or without one to get |".ch"|.
An omitted change file argument means that |"/dev/null"| should be used,
when no changes are desired.

If there's a third file name, it will be the output file.

Because |"_"| is a directory {\em and} extension separator, \.{CWEB} will
always use the {\em full} name (i.e. with full path).  Fortunately the
routine has been written to search for the last ``dot'', so the altered
version will search for the last |"_"| (including directory separators),
so we have what we want.

@ We use all of |*argv| for the |web_file_name| if there is a |'.'| in it,
otherwise we add |".w"|. If this file can't be opened, we prepare an
|alt_web_file_name| by adding |"web"| after the dot.
The other file names come from adding other things
after the dot.  We must check that there is enough room in
|web_file_name| and the other arrays for the argument.

If you've read the section before carefully you'll have noticed, that
QDOS/SMSQ file names contain almost a |"_"|, so this routine will not work,
i.e. you'll {\em have} to add the |"_w"| always.  Nevertheless I adapted
the routine as if it would work.
