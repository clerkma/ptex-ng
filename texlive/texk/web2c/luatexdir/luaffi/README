This is luaffifb from https://github.com/facebook/luaffifb
patched to compile for TeXLive..

It should compile even where the ffi is not defined,
because there is a ffi stub that does nothing:

local info = [[
The ffi module is available for:
 
    archictures       : ARCH_X86, ARCH_X64 and ARM_64,
    operating systems : OS_CE, OS_WIN, OS_LINUX, OS_BSD and OS_POSIX

The ARM 32bit processor is currently not supported. There are subtle
differences between this module and the one in luajitTeX 
and we hope to be in sync around TeXLive 2025.
Different OS can have different interfaces,
for instance OS_WIN has not 'complex.h'. If you want portable
code, stick to the most common concepts.
]]

local function stub()
    texio.write_nl(info)
end

ffi = {
    fill      = stub,
    cast      = stub,
    offsetof  = stub,
    copy      = stub,
    string    = stub,
    abi       = stub,
    cdef      = stub,
    typeof    = stub,
    sizeof    = stub,
    type      = stub,
    number    = stub,
    gc        = stub,
    metatype  = stub,
    errno     = stub,
    debug     = stub,
    os        = ''  ,
    arch      = ''  ,
    NULL      = nil ,
    alignof   = stub,
    new       = stub,
    u64       = stub,
    i64       = stub,
    istype    = stub,
    load      = stub,
    C         = nil ,
}


So the following chunk of code can be used as an 
example of how to check the ffi:

 if ffi then 
   if (ffi.os=='' and ffi.arch=='') then
   -- ffi is the stub
   -- or it's not a sane ffi
   -- This should print something on terminal
      print(ffi.cdef(''))
   else
   -- ffi looks ok
   end
 else
   -- no ffi at all: perhaps an old luatex ?
 end

The ARCH enabled ARCH_X86 and ARCH_X64, 
the OS enabled are OS_CE, OS_WIN, OS_LINUX, OS BD and OS_POSIX.
Currently ARM is not supported.

The module is not aligned with  luajit-2.1.0.beta2
(the plan is to be in sync for TeXLive 2025) and 
test.lua can fail. Be careful that different OS have different 
interfaces (i.e. OS_WIN has not complex.h, for example)
so extra care must be take to ensure code portability.
