@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

@cindex introduction

This manual corresponds to version @value{version} of Web2c, released in
@value{month-year}.

@cindex Knuth, Donald E.
@cindex @TeX{}, Web2c implementation of
@cindex Hobby, John
@cindex Breitenlohner, Peter
@dfn{Web2c} is the name of a @TeX{} implementation, originally for
Unix, but now also running under various operating systems. By
@dfn{@TeX{} implementation}, we mean all of the standard programs
developed by the Stanford @TeX{} project directed by Donald E. Knuth:
Metafont, DVItype, GFtoDVI, Bib@TeX{}, Tangle, etc., as well as @TeX{}
itself. Other programs are also included: DVIcopy, written by Peter
Breitenlohner, MetaPost and its utilities (derived from Metafont), by
John Hobby, etc.

@cindex translation from WEB to C
@cindex strategy, overall
General strategy: Web2c works, as its name implies, by translating the
WEB source in which @TeX{} is written into C source code. Its output is
not self-contained, however; it makes extensive use of many macros and
functions in a library (the @file{web2c/lib} directory in the sources).
Therefore, it will not work without change on an arbitrary WEB program.

@cindex licensing terms
@cindex freedom of Web2c
@cindex ice cream
@cindex Henry, Patrick
Availability: All of Web2c is freely available---``free'' both in the
sense of no cost (free ice cream) and of having the source code to
modify and/or redistribute (free speech).  @xref{unixtex.ftp,,,
kpathsea, Kpathsea}, for the practical details of how to obtain Web2c.

Different parts of the Web2c distribution have different licensing
terms, however, reflecting the different circumstances of their
creation; consult each source file for exact details.  The main
practical implication for redistributors of Web2c is that most of the
executables are covered by the GNU General Public License or GNU
Lesser General Public License, and therefore anyone who gets a binary
distribution must also get the sources, as explained by the terms of
the GPL (@url{https://gnu.org/licenses/}. The GPL covers the Web2c
executables, including @code{tex}, because the Free Software
Foundation sponsored the initial development of the Kpathsea library
that Web2c uses.  The basic source files from Stanford, however, have
their own copyright terms or are in the public domain, and are not
covered by the GPL.

@cindex history
@cindex Rokicki, Tomas
@cindex Trickey, Howard
@cindex Curtis, Pavel
@cindex Morgan, Tim
@cindex Berry, Karl
@cindex Weber, Olaf
History: Tomas Rokicki originated the @TeX{}-to-C system in 1987,
working from the first change files for @TeX{} under Unix, which were
done primarily by Howard Trickey and Pavel Curtis. Tim Morgan then
took over development and maintenance for a number of years; the name
changed to Web-to-C somewhere in there.  In 1990, Karl Berry became
the maintainer.  He made many changes to the original sources, and
started using the shorter name Web2c.  In 1997, Olaf Weber took over,
and then in 2006, Karl started taking care of it again.  No
significant development or changes have been needed for many
years. Dozens of other people have contributed; their names are listed
in the @file{ChangeLog} files.

@cindex acknowledgements
@cindex Martin, Rick
@cindex Morris, Bob
@cindex Stallman, Richard
Other acknowledgements by Karl: The University of Massachusetts at Boston
(particularly Rick Martin and Bob Morris) provided computers and ftp
access to me for many years.  Richard Stallman at the Free Software
Foundation employed me while I wrote the original path searching library
(for the GNU font utilities).  (rms also gave us Emacs, GDB, and GCC,
without which I cannot imagine developing Web2c.)  And, of course,
@TeX{} would not exist in the first place without Donald E. Knuth.

@chapter Commonalities

@cindex commonalities

Many aspects of the @TeX{} system are the same among more than one
program, so we describe those pieces together, here.

@menu
* Option conventions::   -- or -, = or ` ' for values.
* Common options::       --help --version --verbose, and TeX/MF/MP options.
* Path searching::       Features of the common path searching library.
* Output file location:: TEXMFOUTPUT allows output in places other than `.'.
@end menu


@node Option conventions
@section Option conventions

@cindex option conventions
@cindex conventions for options,

@findex getopt_long_only
To provide a clean and consistent behavior, we chose to have all these
programs use the GNU function @code{getopt_long_only} to parse command
lines.  However, we do use in a restricted mode, where all the options
have to come before the rest of the arguments.

@opindex - @r{starts option names}
@opindex -- @r{starts option names}
As a result, you can:
@itemize @bullet
@item
use @samp{-} or @samp{--} to start an option name;

@item
use any unambiguous abbreviation for an option name;

@item
separate option names and values with either @samp{=} or one or more
spaces;

@item
@flindex - @r{starting a filename}
@cindex filenames starting with @samp{-}
use filenames that would otherwise look like options by putting them
after an option @samp{--}.
@end itemize

By convention, non-option arguments, if specified, generally define the
name of an input file, as documented for each program.

If a particular option with a value is given more than once, it is the
last value that counts.

For example, the following command line specifies the options
@samp{foo}, @samp{bar}, and @samp{verbose}; gives the value @samp{baz}
to the @samp{abc} option, and the value @samp{xyz} to the @samp{quux}
option; and specifies the filename @file{-myfile-}.

@example
-foo --bar -verb -abc=baz -quux karl --quux xyz -- -myfile-
@end example


@node Common options
@section Common options

@cindex common options
All of these programs accept the standard GNU @samp{--help} and
@samp{--version} options, and several programs accept
@samp{--verbose}.  Rather than writing identical descriptions for
every program, they are described here.

@table @samp
@item --help
@opindex --help @r{common option}
@cindex help, online
Print a usage message listing basic usage and all available options to
standard output, then exit successfully.

@item --verbose
@opindex --verbose @r{common option}
@cindex verbosity, enabling
Print progress reports to standard output.

@item --version
@opindex --version @r{common option}
@cindex version number, finding
Print the version number to standard output, then exit successfully.
@end table

@TeX{}, Metafont, and MetaPost have a number of additional options in
common:

@table @samp
@item -file-line-error
@opindex -file-line-error
@itemx -no-file-line-error
@opindex -no-file-line-error
@opindex -file-line-error-style
@cindex changing error messages style
Change (or do not change) the way error messages are printed. The
alternate style looks like error messages from many compilers and is
easier to parse for some editors that invoke @TeX{}.  This option used
to be called @samp{-file-line-error-style}.

@item -fmt=@var{dumpname}
@itemx -base=@var{dumpname}
@itemx -mem=@var{dumpname}
@opindex -fmt=@var{dumpname}
@opindex -base=@var{dumpname}
@opindex -mem=@var{dumpname}
@cindex dump file
Use @var{dumpname} instead of the program name or a @samp{%&} line to
determine the name of the memory dump file read (@samp{fmt} for @TeX{},
@samp{base} for Metafont, @samp{mem} for MetaPost).  @xref{Memory
dumps}.  Also sets the program name to @var{dumpname} if no
@samp{-progname} option was given.

@item -halt-on-error
@opindex -halt-on-error
@cindex stopping at the first error
Stop processing and exit when an error occurs, as opposed to the normal
process of trying to recover and continue.

@item -ini
@opindex -ini
@cindex program names, special
@cindex initial form, enabling
Enable the ``initial'' form of the program (@pxref{Initial and
virgin}).  This is implicitly set if the program name is @code{initex}
resp.@: @code{inimf}.

@item -interaction=@var{string}
@opindex -interaction=@var{string}
@cindex interaction mode
Set the interaction mode from the command line.  The @var{string} must
be one of @samp{batchmode}, @samp{nonstopmode}, @samp{scrollmode}, or
@samp{errorstopmode}.

@item -jobname=@var{string}
@opindex -jobname=@var{string}
@cindex job name
Set the job name to @var{string}, instead of deriving it from the name
of the input file.

@item -kpathsea-debug=@var{number}
@opindex -kpathsea-debug=@var{number}
@vindex KPATHSEA_DEBUG
@cindex debugging flags, specifying
@cindex path searching debugging
Set path searching debugging flags according to the bits of @var{number}
(@pxref{Debugging,,,kpathsea,Kpathsea}).  You can also specify this in
@code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} environment variable (for all Web2c programs).
(The command line value overrides.)  The most useful value is @samp{-1},
to get all available output.

@item -output-directory=@var{dirname}
@opindex -output-directory
@cindex output directory, specifying
Specify the directory @var{dirname} to which output files are written.
Also look for input files in @var{dirname} first, before looking along
the normal search path.  @xref{Output file location}.

@item -parse-first-line
@opindex -parse-first-line
@itemx -no-parse-first-line
@opindex -no-parse-first-line
@cindex parsing the first line
Check or disable checking whether the first line of the main input
file starts with @samp{%&}, and parse it if it does.  This line can be
used specify the format and/or a TCX file.

@item -progname=@var{string}
@opindex -progname=@var{string}
@cindex binaries, linking
@cindex linking binaries
@cindex program names, special
Set program (and memory dump) name to @var{string}.  This may affect the
search paths and other values used (@pxref{Config files,,, kpathsea,
Kpathsea}).  Using this option is equivalent to making a link named
@var{string} to the binary and then invoking the binary under that
name.  @xref{Memory dumps}.

@item -recorder
@opindex -recorder
@cindex file recorder
Enable the filename recorder.  This makes the program save a list of the
opened files into a file with (by default) extension @samp{.fls}.  For
Aleph, this option is always on, and the file has extension @samp{.ofl}.

Ordinarily, the @samp{.fls} file is written to the same location as
the @samp{.log} file, for example, respecting
@option{-output-directory} if it is given (@pxref{Output file
location}).  However, if @TeX{} processing is done on the command line
(or in response to the @samp{**} prompt), the @samp{.fls} might be
written to the current directory, or include an integer (the current
pid), as in @file{texput1234.fls}.  You can use @option{-jobname} to
explicitly set the basename.

@item -translate-file=@var{tcxfile}
@opindex -translate-file=@var{tcxfile}
@cindex translation file for @TeX{}, specifying
@flindex .tcx @r{character translation files}
@cindex first line of the main input file
Use @var{tcxfile} to define which characters are printable and translations 
between the internal and external character sets.   Moreover, 
@var{tcxfile} can be explicitly declared in  the first line of the main 
input file @samp{%& -translate-file=@var{tcxfile}}.
This is the recommended method for portability reasons.
@xref{TCX files}.

@item -8bit
@opindex -8bit
@cindex 8 bit clean
@flindex 8 bit clean output, specifying
This option specifies that by default all characters should be
considered printable.  If @samp{-translate-file} was given as well, then the
TCX file may mark characters as non-printable.

@end table


@node Path searching
@section Path searching

@cindex path searching

@flindex texmf.cnf
@cindex configuration file reading
All of the Web2c programs, including @TeX{}, which do path searching use
the Kpathsea routines to do so.  The precise names of the environment
and configuration file variables which get searched for particular file
formatted are therefore documented in the Kpathsea manual
(@pxref{Supported file formats,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  Reading
@file{texmf.cnf} (@pxref{Config files,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}), invoking
@code{mktex@dots{}} scripts (@pxref{mktex scripts,,, kpathsea,
Kpathsea}), and so on are all handled by Kpathsea.

@cindex font aliases
@cindex aliases for fonts
@flindex texfonts.map
The programs which read fonts make use of another Kpathsea feature:
@file{texfonts.map}, which allows arbitrary aliases for the actual names
of font files; for example, @samp{Times-Roman} for @samp{ptmr8r.tfm}.
The distributed (and installed by default) @file{texfonts.map} includes
aliases for many widely available PostScript fonts by their PostScript
names.


@node Output file location
@section Output file location

@cindex output file location
@cindex current directory, used for output
@flindex .@r{, used for output}
All the programs generally follow the usual convention for output files.
Namely, they are placed in the directory current when the program is
run, regardless of any input file location; or, in a few cases, output
is to standard output.

For example, if you run @samp{tex /tmp/foo}, for example, the output
will be in @file{./foo.dvi} and @file{./foo.log}, not
@file{/tmp/foo.dvi} and @file{/tmp/foo.log}.

@opindex -output-directory
@cindex output directory, specifying
@cindex readonly directory, running @TeX{} in
You can use the @samp{-output-directory} option to cause all output
files that would normally be written in the current directory to be
written in the specified directory instead.  @xref{Common options}.

@vindex TEXMFOUTPUT@r{, used if @samp{.} unwritable}
@cindex readonly directory, running @TeX{} in
If the current directory is not writable, and @samp{-output-directory}
is not specified, the main programs (@TeX{}, Metafont, MetaPost, and
Bib@TeX{}) make an exception: if the config file or environment
variable value @code{TEXMFOUTPUT} is set (it is not by default),
output files are written to the directory specified.

@vindex TEXMFOUTPUT@r{, used for reading}
@code{TEXMFOUTPUT} is also checked for input files, as @TeX{} often
generates files that need to be subsequently read; for input, no
suffixes (such as @samp{.tex}) are added by default and no exhaustive
path searching is done, the input name is
simply checked as given.


@node Three programs

@cindex three programs
@cindex @TeX{}, Metafont, and MetaPost
@cindex Metafont, MetaPost, and @TeX{}
@cindex MetaPost, @TeX{}, and Metafont

@TeX{}, Metafont, and MetaPost have a number of features in common.
Besides the ones here, command-line options and other commonalities
are described in the previous section.

@node Runtime options
@section Runtime options

@cindex runtime options

@cindex configuration file values
@cindex array sizes
@flindex texmf.cnf
Besides the configure- and compile-time options described in the
installation section (@pxref{Installation}), you can control a number
of parameters in the @file{texmf.cnf} runtime file read by Kpathsea
(@pxref{Config files,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).

The main purpose of @file{texmf.cnf} is to specify search paths, but
array sizes and other options are also set there. Most are rather
obscure.  Here are a few of the more interesting values:

@vtable @samp
@item main_memory
Total words of memory available, for @TeX{}, Metafont, and MetaPost.
Must remake the format file after changing.

@item extra_mem_bot
@cindex boxes, memory for
@cindex glue, memory for
@cindex breakpoints, memory for
@cindex PiC@TeX{}, increasing memory for
Extra space for ``large'' @TeX{} data structures (default 0): boxes,
glue, breakpoints, et al. If you use PiC@TeX{}, you may well want to
set this.

@item expand_depth
@cindex recursive expansion limit
@cindex expansion limit, recursive
@cindex runtime stack overflow
@cindex overflow, of runtime stack
@cindex segmentation fault
@vindex SIGSEGV
Limit on recursive expansion calls before @TeX{} aborts (default
10000). If a @TeX{} program does an unterminated recursive expansion,
@TeX{} will dutifully expand macros until the system's runtime stack
overflows, typically with a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV). This
parameter was introduced to minimize the chance of that unpleasant
(though not dangerous) crash, instead allowing @TeX{} to quit with a
more informative message.

@pindex libsigsegv @r{library}
The crash can still happen, though, if the system has an exceptionally
small memory allocation for its stack. There is no quantitative way to
determine the limit, and it does not seem worth implementing
system-dependent heuristics to guess at the number, since it's highly
improbable that any real @TeX{} code will ever need more than 10000
recursive expansions (it has never happened). For the same reason,
using the libsigsegv library (@url{https://gnu.org/s/libsigsegv}) does
not seem worth the effort.

@item texmf_casefold_search
@xref{Casefolding search,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}.

@end vtable

@cindex array limit, fixed
@cindex swap space, as array limit
@cindex reallocation of arrays
@cindex dynamic array allocation
Ideally all arrays would be dynamically expanded as necessary, so the
only limiting factor would be the amount of swap space available, or
some configurable limit much larger than can currently be supported.

Unfortunately, implementing this is extremely difficult, as the fixed
size of arrays is assumed in many places throughout the source code.
These runtime limits are a practical compromise between the
compile-time limits in previous versions, and truly dynamic arrays.
(On the other hand, the Web2c Bib@TeX{} implementation does do true
dynamic reallocation of some arrays.)

@cindex modifying @file{texmf.cnf} in @TeX{} Live
@cindex location of @file{texmf.cnf} in @TeX{} Live
Nowadays there is rarely a reason to modify the values. But if you do
wish to modify @file{texmf.cnf}, in @TeX{} Live the best approach is
to put your changes, and only your changes at the top of the TL
installation tree. That is, if the system @file{texmf.cnf} is
installed in
@file{/some/path/to/texlive/YYYY/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf} is put
your custom settings in @file{/some/path/to/texlive/YYY/texmf.cnf},
where @var{YYYY} is the year of installation (if you use that
subdirectory; it's the default).  That way, unrelated changes to the
system @file{texmf.cnf} can happen with normal updates, without
affecting your local values.


@node Initial and virgin
@section Initial and virgin

@cindex executables, shared initial and virgin
The @TeX{} and Metafont programs each have two main variants, called
@dfn{initial} and @dfn{virgin}.  MetaPost no longer makes this
distinction.

The initial form is enabled if:
@enumerate
@item
@opindex -ini
the @samp{-ini} option was specified; or
@item
the program name is @file{initex} resp.@: @file{inimf}; or
@item
the first line of the main input file is @samp{%&ini};
@end enumerate
@noindent
otherwise, the virgin form is used.

@cindex virgin programs
@cindex production use
The @dfn{virgin} form is the one generally invoked for production use.
The first thing it does is read a memory dump (@pxref{Determining the
memory dump to use}), and then proceeds on with the main job.

@cindex initial programs
@cindex initializations, lengthy
The @dfn{initial} form is generally used only to create memory dumps
(see the next section).  It starts up more slowly than the virgin form,
because it must do lengthy initializations that are encapsulated in the
memory dump file.


@node Memory dumps
@section Memory dumps

@cindex dumping memory

@cindex memory dumps, creating
@cindex creating memory dumps
@cindex writing memory dumps

The programs all create memory dumps in slightly idiosyncratic (thought
substantially similar) way, so we describe the details in separate
sections (references below).  The basic idea is to run the initial
version of the program (@pxref{Initial and virgin}), read the source
file to define the macros, and then execute the @code{\dump} primitive.

Also, each program uses a different filename extension for its memory
dumps, since although they are completely analogous they are not
interchangeable (@TeX{} cannot read a Metafont memory dump, for
example).

Here is a list of filename extensions with references to examples of
creating memory dumps:

When making memory dumps, the programs read environment variables and
configuration files for path searching and other values as usual.  If
you are making a new installation and have environment variables
pointing to an old one, for example, you will probably run into
difficulties.


@node Determining the memory dump to use
@subsection Determining the memory dump to use

@cindex memory dump to use, determining
@cindex fmt file, determining
@cindex base file, determining
@cindex mem file, determining

The virgin form (@pxref{Initial and virgin}) of each program always
reads a memory dump before processing normal source input.  All three
programs determine the memory dump to use in the same way:

@enumerate
@item
If the first non-option command-line argument begins with @samp{&}, the
program uses the remainder of that argument as the memory dump name.
For example, running @samp{tex \&super} reads @file{super.fmt}.  (The
backslash protects the @samp{&} against interpretation by the shell.)

@item
@opindex -fmt=@var{fmt}
@opindex -base=@var{base}
If the @samp{-fmt} resp.@: @samp{-base} option is
specified, its value is used.

@item
@opindex -progname=@var{string}
If the @samp{-progname} option is specified, its value is used.

@item
@kindex %& @r{magic number}
If the first line of the main input file (which must be specified on the
command line, not in response to @samp{**}) is @code{%&@var{dump}}, and
@var{dump} is an existing memory dump of the appropriate type,
@var{dump} is used.

The first line of the main input file can also specify which character
translation file is to be used: @code{%&-translate-file=@var{tcxfile}}
(@pxref{TCX files}).

These two roles can be combined: @code{%&@var{dump}
-translate-file=@var{tcxfile}}.  If this is done, the name of the dump
must be given first.

@item
@cindex program name, determines memory dump
@cindex links to binaries
Otherwise, the program uses the program invocation name, most commonly
@file{tex} resp.@: @file{mf}.  For example, if @file{latex} is a link
to @file{tex}, and the user runs @samp{latex foo}, @file{latex.fmt}
will be used.

@end enumerate

@cindex dependencies, hardware
@opindex --disable-dump-share configure @r{option}
By default, memory dump files are generally sharable between
architectures of different types; specifically, on machines of different
endianness (@pxref{Byte order,,,libc,GNU C Library}).  (This is a
feature of the Web2c implementation, and is not true of all @TeX{}
implementations.)  If you specify @samp{--disable-dump-share} to
@code{configure}, however, memory dumps will be endian-dependent.

@cindex byte swapping
@cindex swapping bytes
The reason to do this is speed.  To achieve endian-independence, the
reading of memory dumps on LittleEndian architectures, such as PC's and
DEC architectures, is somewhat slowed (all the multibyte values have to
be swapped).  Usually, this is not noticeable, and the advantage of
being able to share memory dumps across all platforms at a site far
outweighs the speed loss.  But if you're installing Web2c for use on
LittleEndian machines only, perhaps on a PC being used only by you, you
may wish to get maximum speed.

@cindex floating-point values
@cindex glue ratio representations
@TeX{}nically, even without @samp{--disable-dump-share}, sharing of
@file{.fmt} files cannot be guaranteed to work.  Floating-point values
are always written in native format, and hence will generally not be
readable across platforms.  Fortunately, @TeX{} uses floating point
only to represent glue ratios, and all common formats (plain,
@LaTeX{}, AMS@TeX{}, @dots{}) do not do any glue setting at
@file{.fmt}-creation time.  Metafont does not use floating point in
any dumped value at all.

@cindex date and time, in memory dumps
@cindex time and date, in memory dumps
@cindex memory dumps, contain date and time
Incidentally, different memory dump files will never compare equal
byte-for-byte, because the program always dumps the current date and
time. So don't be alarmed by just a few bytes difference.

@cindex Harbison, Samuel P.
@cindex Steele Jr., Guy L.
If you don't know what endianness your machine is, and you're curious,
here is a little C program to tell you. (The @code{configure} script
contains a similar program.)  This is from the book @cite{C: A Reference
Manual}, by Samuel P. Harbison and Guy L. Steele
Jr@:. (@pxref{References}).

@example
main ()
@{
  /* Are we little or big endian?  From Harbison&Steele.  */
  union
  @{
    long l;
    char c[sizeof (long)];
  @} u;
  u.l = 1;
  if (u.c[0] == 1)
    printf ("LittleEndian\n");
  else if (u.c[sizeof (long) - 1] == 1)
    printf ("BigEndian\n");
  else
    printf ("unknownEndian");

  exit (u.c[sizeof (long) - 1] == 1);

@node Editor invocation
@section Editor invocation

@cindex editor invoked at error
@cindex errors, editor invoked at
@opindex e @r{response at error prompt}

@TeX{}, Metafont, and MetaPost all (by default) stop and ask for user
intervention at an error.  If the input came from a file, and the user
responds with @kbd{e} or @kbd{E}, the program invokes an editor.

@vindex TEXEDIT
@vindex MFEDIT
@vindex MPEDIT
@opindex --with-editor=@var{cmd}
@flindex texmf.cnf @r{for editors}
Specifying @samp{--with-editor=@var{cmd}} to @code{configure} sets the
default editor command string to @var{cmd}.  The environment
variables/configuration values @code{TEXEDIT}, @code{MFEDIT}, and
@code{MPEDIT} (respectively) override this.  If @samp{--with-editor} is
not specified, the default is @code{vi +%d %s} on Unix, and an
invocation of the @TeX{}works editor on Windows.  (See
@file{texmf.cnf} for the precise values.)

In this string, @samp{%d} is replaced by the line number of the error,
and @samp{%s} is replaced by the name of the current input file.


@node \input filenames
@section @code{\input} filenames

@cindex input filenames
@cindex filename conventions, in input files
@findex \input @r{filenames}

@TeX{}, Metafont, and MetaPost source programs can all read other source
files with the @code{\input} (@TeX{}) and @code{input} (MF and MP)
primitives:
@example
\input @var{name} % in TeX
@end example

@cindex space-terminated filenames
@cindex whitespace-terminated filenames
@cindex terminator for filenames
The file @var{name} can always be terminated with whitespace; for
Metafont and MetaPost, the statement terminator @samp{;} also works.
(@LaTeX{} and other macro packages provide other interfaces to
@code{\input} that allow different notation; here we are concerned only
with the primitive operation.)  

As (allowed) extensions to standard @TeX{}, Web2c also supports
specifying the filename in double quotes (@code{"some name"}) and in
braces (@code{@{"some name"@}}), which is convenient for filenames
containing spaces or other special characters, as described in the
sections below.

In all cases, space tokens are ignored after the filename is read.

@cindex @code{"} character, ignored in filenames
@cindex double quote character, ignored in filenames
Also, double quote (@code{"}) characters are ignored within the
filename; there is no way to read files whose names contain a @code{"}.

@cindex portable filenames
However, for maximal portability of your document across systems, use
only the characters @samp{a}--@samp{z}, @samp{0}--@samp{9}, and
@samp{.}.  Do not use anything but simple filenames, since directory
separators vary among systems; instead, add the necessary directories
to the appropriate search path.

@node \input quoted filename
@subsection @code{\input} quoted filename: @code{\input "some name"}

@cindex @code{\input} quoted filename
@cindex quoted filename for @code{\input}

As of Web2c version 7.5.3 (2004), double-quote characters can be used
to include spaces or other special characters.  In typical use, the
@samp{"} characters surround the entire filename:
@example
\input "filename with spaces"
@end example

Technically, the quote characters can be used inside the name, and
can enclose any characters, as in:
@example
\input filename" "with" "spaces
@end example

One more point.  In @LaTeX{}, the quotes are needed inside the braces
of its @code{\input} macro, thus:
@example
\input@{a b@}    % fails
\input@{"a b"@}  % ok
@end example

There is no way to quote the quote character.


@node \input braced filename
@subsection @code{\input} braced filename: @code{\input@{some name@}}

@cindex @code{\input} braced (grouped) filename
@cindex braced filename for @code{\input}
@cindex group-delimited filename for @code{\input}

As of Web2c 2020, @code{\input} filenames in @TeX{} engines (this does
not apply in Metafont and MetaPost) can also be specified within a
@TeX{} group, typically curly braces. For example:
@example
\input@{filename with spaces@}
@end example

As always with @TeX{}, the brace characters are not hardwired; what
counts is the category code: the first token after the @code{\input}
must be of catcode@tie{}1 (begin group), and it is matched with the
next character of catcode@tie{}2 (end group).

Within the group-delimited filename, braces are treated as normal
characters.

As with all forms of filenames, following spaces are ignored (after
the end group), and double quote (@code{"}) characters are ignored
within the filename.


@node \input filename caveats
@subsection @code{\input} filename caveats

@cindex @code{\input} filename caveats
@cindex caveats for @code{\input} filenames
@cindex tokenization, and @code{\input} filenames
@cindex expansion, and @code{\input} filenames
@cindex multiple spaces, and @code{\input} filenames
@cindex tabs, and @code{\input} filenames
The quoting mechanisms just described come into play @emph{after}
@TeX{} has tokenized and expanded the input.  So, multiple spaces and
tabs will generally be seen as a single space, active characters such
as @samp{~} are expanded first (generally causing an error), and so
on.  More examples below.

@cindex NUL, not allowed in filenames
@cindex eight-bit characters in filenames
@cindex meta characters in filenames
On the other hand, various C library routines and Unix itself use the null
byte (character code zero, ASCII NUL) to terminate strings.  So
filenames in Web2c cannot contain nulls, even though @TeX{} itself does
not treat NUL specially.

@kindex ~ @r{expansion in filenames}
@kindex $ @r{expansion in filenames}
Finally, the present Web2c implementation does @samp{~} and @samp{$}
expansion on @var{name}, unlike Knuth's original implementation.
Thus:
@example
\input ~jsmith/$foo.bar
@end example
will dereference the environment variable or Kpathsea config file
value @samp{foo} and read that file, extended with @samp{.bar}, in
user @samp{jsmith}'s home directory.  You can also use braces in the
variable expansion, as in @samp{$@{foo@}bar}, if you want to follow
the variable name with a letter, numeral, or @samp{_}.

(So another way to get a program to read a filename containing
whitespace is to define an environment variable and dereference it.)

@findex \string@r{, and @code{\input filenames}}
In all the common @TeX{} formats (plain @TeX{}, @LaTeX{}, Con@TeX{}t,
AMS@TeX{}, @dots{}), the characters @samp{~} and @samp{$} have special
category codes, so to actually use these in a document you have to
change their catcodes or use @code{\string}.

@TeX{} is a batch language, like C or Pascal, and not an interactive

considerable disadvantages and considerable advantages.  For a complete

@node tex invocation
@section @code{tex} invocation

@pindex tex
@cindex @TeX{}, invocation

@TeX{} (usually invoked as @code{tex}) formats the given text and
commands, and outputs a corresponding device-independent representation
of the typeset document.  This section merely describes the options
available in the Web2c implementation.  For a complete description of
the @TeX{} typesetting language, see @cite{The @TeX{}book}
(@pxref{References}).

@TeX{}, Metafont, and MetaPost process the command line (described
here) and determine their memory dump (fmt) file in the same way
(@pxref{Memory dumps}).  Synopses:

@example
tex [@var{option}]@dots{} [@var{texname}[.tex]] [@var{tex-commands}]
tex [@var{option}]@dots{} \@var{first-line}
tex [@var{option}]@dots{} &@var{fmt} @var{args}
@end example

@flindex .tex
@cindex @TeX{}, input files found
@TeX{} searches the usual places for the main input file @var{texname}
(@pxref{Supported file formats,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}), extending
@var{texname} with @file{.tex} if necessary.  To see all the
relevant paths, set the environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to
@samp{-1} before running the program.

After @var{texname} is read, @TeX{} processes any remaining
@var{tex-commands} on the command line as regular @TeX{} input.  Also,
if the first non-option argument begins with a @TeX{} escape character
(usually @code{\}), @TeX{} processes all non-option command-line
arguments as a line of regular @TeX{} input.

If no arguments or options are specified, @TeX{} prompts for an
input file name with @samp{**}.

@flindex texput
@TeX{} writes the main DVI output to the file
@file{@var{basetexname}.dvi}, where @var{basetexname} is the basename of
@var{texname}, or @samp{texput} if no input file was specified.  A DVI
file is a device-independent binary representation of your @TeX{}
document.  The idea is that after running @TeX{}, you translate the DVI
file using a separate program to the commands for a particular output
device, such as a PostScript printer
(@pxref{Top,,Introduction,dvips,Dvips}) or an X Window System display
(see xdvi(1)).

@cindex EC fonts
@pindex mktextfM@r{, disabling}
@findex \font @r{and dynamic generation}
@TeX{} also reads TFM files for any fonts you load in your document with
the @code{\font} primitive.  By default, it runs an external program
named @file{mktextfm} to create any nonexistent TFM files.  You can
disable this at configure-time or runtime (@pxref{mktex
configuration,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  This is enabled mostly for the
sake of the EC fonts, which can be generated at any size.

@findex \openout @r{and security}
@cindex security, and @code{\openout}
@cindex output files, written by @TeX{} programs
@cindex Trojan horses and @TeX{} programs
@cindex dot files, written by @TeX{} programs
@cindex security, and output files
@TeX{} can write output files, via the @code{\openout} primitive; this opens
a security hole vulnerable to Trojan horse attack: an unwitting user could
run a @TeX{} program that overwrites, say, @file{~/.rhosts}.  (MetaPost has
a @code{write} primitive with similar implications).  To alleviate this and
similar problems the functions @code{kpathsea_out_name_ok} and
@code{kpathsea_in_name_ok} from the Kpathse library (@pxref{Calling
sequence,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}) are used to determine if a given filename
is acceptable to be opened for output or input, depending on the setting of
the configuration variables @code{openout_any} and @code{openin_any}:
@samp{a} (for ``any'', the default for @code{openin_any}), @samp{r} (for
``restricted''), or @samp{p} (for ``paranoid'', the default for
@code{openout_any}).

In any case, all @code{\openout} filenames are recorded in the log file,
except those opened on the first line of input, which is processed when
the log file has not yet been opened.

The program accepts the following options, as well as the standard
@samp{-help} and @samp{-version} (@pxref{Common options}):
@table @samp
@item -enc
@itemx -[no]-file-line-error

@opindex -ipc

opens a server program at the other end to read the output.  @xref{IPC

@item -src-specials
@itemx -src-specials=@var{string}
@cindex generating source specials
This option makes @TeX{} output specific source information using
@samp{\special} commands in the DVI file. These @samp{\special} track
the current file name and line number.

Using the first form of this option, the @samp{\special} commands are
inserted automatically.

In the second form of the option, @var{string} is
a comma separated list of the following values: @samp{cr},
@samp{display}, @samp{hbox}, @samp{math}, @samp{par}, @samp{parend},
@samp{vbox}. You can use this list to specify where you want  @TeX{} to
output such commands. For example, @samp{-src-specials=cr,math} will
output source information every line and every math formula.

These commands  can  be used with  the  appropriate DVI viewer and  text
editor to switch from the current position in the editor to the same
position in the viewer and back from the viewer
to the editor.

This option works by inserting @samp{\special} commands into the token
stream, and thus in principle these additional tokens can be recovered
or seen by the tricky-enough macros.  If you run across a case, let us
know, because this counts as a bug.  However, such bugs are very hard
to fix, requiring significant changes to @TeX{}, so please don't count
on it.

Redefining @samp{\special} will not affect the functioning of this
option.  The commands inserted into the token stream are
hard-coded to always use the @samp{\special} primitive.

@TeX{} does not pass the trip test when this option is enabled.

@TeX{} @dfn{formats} are large collections of macros, often dumped
into a @file{.fmt} file (@pxref{Memory dumps}) by @code{tex -ini}
(@pxref{Initial TeX}).  A number of formats are in reasonably
widespread use, and the Web2c Makefile has targets to make the versions
current at the time of release.  You can change which formats are
automatically built by setting the @code{fmts} Make variable; by default,
only the @samp{plain} and @samp{latex} formats are made.

You can get the latest versions of most of these formats from the CTAN
archives in subdirectories of @file{@var{CTAN:}/macros} (for CTAN info,
@pxref{unixtex.ftp,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  The archive

Multi-lingual @TeX{} (@code{mltex}) is an extension of @TeX{} originally
written by Michael Ferguson and now updated and maintained by Bernd
Raichle.  With the advent of Unicode, it has become obsolete, though
it is still supported in Web2c in the event of bugs or compilation
bugs.

ML@TeX{} allows the use of non-existing glyphs in a font by declaring
glyph substitutions.  These are restricted to substitutions of an
accented character glyph, which need not be defined in the current
font, by its appropriate @code{\accent} construction using a base and
accent character glyph, which do have to exist in the current font.
This substitution is automatically done behind the scenes, if
necessary, and thus ML@TeX{} additionally supports hyphenation of
words containing an accented character glyph for fonts missing this
glyph (e.g., Computer Modern).  Standard @TeX{} suppresses hyphenation
in this case.

ML@TeX{} works at @file{.fmt}-creation time: the basic idea is to
specify the @samp{-mltex} option to @TeX{} when you @code{\dump} a
format.  Then, when you subsequently invoke @TeX{} and read that
@code{.fmt} file, the ML@TeX{} features described below will be enabled.

Generally, you use special macro files to create an ML@TeX{} @code{.fmt}
file.

The sections below describe the two new primitives that ML@TeX{} defines.
Aside from these, ML@TeX{} is completely compatible with standard @TeX{}.

@node \charsubdef
@subsubsection @code{\charsubdef}: Character substitutions

@findex \charsubdef @r{and ML@TeX{}}

The most important primitive ML@TeX{} adds is @code{\charsubdef}, used
in a way reminiscent of @code{\chardef}:
@example
\charsubdef @var{composite} [=] @var{accent} @var{base}
@end example

Each of @var{composite}, @var{accent}, and @var{base} are font glyph
numbers, expressed in the usual @TeX{} syntax: @t{`\e} symbolically,
@t{'145} for octal, @t{"65} for hex, @t{101} for decimal.

ML@TeX{}'s @code{\charsubdef} declares how to construct an accented
character glyph (not necessarily existing in the current font) using two
character glyphs (that do exist).  Thus it defines whether a character
glyph code, either typed as a single character or using the @code{\char}
primitive, will be mapped to a font glyph or to an @code{\accent} glyph
construction.

For example, if you assume glyph code 138
@cindex e-circumflex
(decimal) for an e-circumflex
@tex
(\^e)
@end tex
and you are using the Computer Modern fonts, which have the circumflex
accent in position 18 and lowercase `e' in the usual ASCII position 101
decimal, you would use @code{\charsubdef} as follows:

@example
\charsubdef 138 = 18 101
@end example

For the plain @TeX{} format to make use of this substitution, you have
to redefine the circumflex accent macro @code{\^} in such a way that if
its argument is character `e' the expansion @code{\char138 } is used
instead of @code{\accent18 e}.  Similar @code{\charsubdef} declaration
and macro redefinitions have to be done for all other accented
characters.

To disable a previous @code{\charsubdef @var{c}}, redefine @var{c}
as a pair of zeros. For example:
@example
\charsubdef '321 = 0 0  % disable N tilde
@end example
@cindex N tilde
@noindent
(Octal @t{'321} is the ISO Latin-1 value for the Spanish N tilde.)

@code{\charsubdef} commands should only be given once.  Although in
principle you can use @code{\charsubdef} at any time, the result is
unspecified.  If @code{\charsubdef} declarations are changed, usually
either incorrect character dimensions will be used or ML@TeX{} will
output missing character warnings.  (The substitution of a
@code{\charsubdef} is used by @TeX{} when appending the character node
to the current horizontal list, to compute the width of a horizontal box
when the box gets packed, and when building the @code{\accent}
construction at @code{\shipout}-time.  In summary, the substitution is
accessed often, so changing it is not desirable, nor generally useful.)


@node \tracingcharsubdef
@subsubsection @code{\tracingcharsubdef}: Substitution diagnostics

@findex \tracingcharsubdef @r{and ML@TeX{}}
@cindex redefined character substitutions
To help diagnose problems with @samp{\charsubdef}, ML@TeX{} provides a
new primitive parameter, @code{\tracingcharsubdef}.  If positive, every
use of @code{\charsubdef} will be reported.  This can help track down
when a character is redefined.

@findex \tracinglostchars @r{and ML@TeX{}}
In addition, if the @TeX{} parameter @code{\tracinglostchars} is 100 or
more, the character substitutions actually performed at
@code{\shipout}-time will be recorded.


@node TCX files
@subsection TCX files: Character translations

@flindex TCX @r{character translation files}
@flindex .tcx @r{character translation files}
@cindex character translation files

@cindex international characters
@cindex 8-bit characters
@cindex accented character
TCX (@TeX{} character translation) files help @TeX{} support direct
input of 8-bit international characters if fonts containing those
characters are being used.  Specifically, they map an input (keyboard)
character code to the internal @TeX{} character code (a superset of
ASCII).

Of the various proposals for handling more than one input encoding,
TCX files were chosen because they follow Knuth's original ideas for
the use of the @samp{xchr} and @samp{xord} tables.  He ventured that
these would be changed in the WEB source in order to adjust the actual
version to a given environment.  It turns out, however, that
recompiling the WEB sources is not as simple a task as Knuth may have
imagined; therefore, TCX files, providing the possibility of changing
of the conversion tables on on-the-fly, have been implemented instead.

This approach limits the portability of @TeX{} documents, as some
implementations do not support it (or use a different method for
input-internal reencoding).  It may also be problematic to determine
the encoding to use for a @TeX{} document of unknown provenance; in
the worst case, failure to do so correctly may result in subtle errors
in the typeset output.  But we feel the benefits outweigh these
disadvantages.

This is entirely independent of the ML@TeX{} extension (@pxref{MLTeX}):
whereas a TCX file defines how an input keyboard character is mapped to
@TeX{}'s internal code, ML@TeX{} defines substitutions for a
non-existing character glyph in a font with a @code{\accent}
construction made out of two separate character glyphs.  TCX files
involve no new primitives; it is not possible to specify
that an input (keyboard) character maps to more than one character.

@vindex WEB2C@r{, search path for TCX files}
Information on specifying TCX files:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The best way to specify a TCX file is to list it explicitly in the
first line of the main document:
@example
%& -translate-file=@var{tcxfile}
@end example

@item
You can also specify a TCX file to be used on a particular @TeX{} run
with the command-line option @samp{-translate-file=@var{tcxfile}}.

@item
TCX files are searched for along the @code{WEB2C} path.

@item
Initial @TeX{} (@pxref{Initial TeX,,Initial @TeX{}}) ignores TCX files.
@end itemize

@flindex il1-t1.tcx
@flindex il2-t1.tcx
@flindex empty.tcx
@cindex Cork encoding and ISO input
@cindex T1 encoding and ISO input
The Web2c distribution comes with a number of TCX files.  Two
important ones are @file{il1-t1.tcx} and @file{il2-t1.tcx}, which
support ISO Latin 1 and ISO Latin 2, respectively, with Cork-encoded
fonts (a.k.a.@ the @LaTeX{} T1 encoding).  TCX files for Czech,
Polish, and Slovak are also provided.

One other notable TCX file is @file{empty.tcx}, which is, well,
empty.  Its purpose is to reset Web2C's behavior to the default (only
visible ASCII being printable, as described below) when a format was
dumped with another TCX being active---which is in fact the case for
everything but plain @TeX{} in the TeX Live and other distributions.
Thus:

@example
latex somefile8.tex
@result{} terminal etc. output with 8-bit chars
latex --translate-file=empty.tcx somefile8.tex
@result{} terminal etc. output with ^^ notation
@end example

@cindex syntax of TCX files
Syntax of TCX files:
@enumerate
@item
@cindex blank lines, in TCX files
Line-oriented. Blank lines are ignored.

@item
@cindex whitespace, in TCX files
Whitespace is ignored except as a separator.

@item
@cindex comments, in TCX files
Comments start with @samp{%} and continue to the end of the line.

@item
Otherwise, a line consists of one or two character codes, optionally
followed by 0 or 1.  The last number indicates whether @var{dest} is
considered printable.
@example
@var{src} [@var{dest} [@var{prnt}]]
@end example

@item
@cindex character codes, in TCX files
@cindex octal character codes, in TCX files
@cindex hex character codes, in TCX files
@cindex decimal character codes, in TCX files
Each character code may be specified in octal with a leading @samp{0},
hexadecimal with a leading @samp{0x}, or decimal otherwise. Values must
be between 0 and 255, inclusive (decimal).

@item
If the @var{dest} code is not specified, it is taken to be the same as
@var{src}.

@item
If the same @var{src} code is specified more than once, it is the last
definition that counts.
@end enumerate

@cindex printable characters, specifying
@kindex ^^ @r{notation, avoiding}
Finally, here's what happens: when @TeX{} sees an input character with
code @var{src}, it 1) changes @var{src} to @var{dest}; and 2) makes the
@var{dest} code ``printable'', i.e., printed as-is in diagnostics and the
log file rather than in @samp{^^} notation.

By default, no characters are translated, and character codes between 32
and 126 inclusive (decimal) are printable.

Specifying translations for the printable ASCII characters (codes
32--127) will yield unpredictable results.  Additionally you shouldn't
make the following characters printable: @code{^^I} (TAB), @code{^^J}
(line feed), @code{^^M} (carriage return), and @code{^^?} (delete),
since @TeX{} uses them in various ways.

@cindex font character code, translating
@cindex keyboard character code, translating
Thus, the idea is to specify the input (keyboard) character code for
@var{src}, and the output (font) character code for @var{dest}.

@cindex interaction between TCX files and @samp{-8bit}.
By default, only the printable ASCII characters are considered printable
by @TeX{}.  If you specify the @samp{-8bit} option, all characters are
considered printable by default.  If you specify both the @samp{-8bit}
option and a TCX file, then the TCX can set specific characters to be
non-printable.

Both the specified TCX encoding and whether characters are printable
are saved in the dump files (like @file{tex.fmt}).  So by giving these
options in combination with @samp{-ini}, you control the defaults seen
by anyone who uses the resulting dump file.

When loading a dump, if the @samp{-8bit} option was given, then all
characters become printable by default.

When loading a dump, if a TCX file was specified, then the TCX data from
the dump is ignored and the data from the file used instead.

@c by two consecutive delimiters. The delimiter may be any character not
@c occurring in either version.

In addition, Patgen prompts interactively for other values.

@node Shell escapes
@section Shell escapes

@vindex shell_escape @r{enabling in @TeX{}}
@findex \immediate\write18
@findex \write18 @r{shell escape extension}
@findex system @r{C library function}
@flindex texmf.cnf @r{for shell escapes}

@TeX{} can execute @dfn{shell escapes}, that is, arbitrary shell
commands.  Although tremendously useful, this also has obvious
security implications.  Therefore, as of @TeX{} Live 2009, a
@dfn{restricted} mode for shell escapes is the default mode of
operation, which allows executing only certain commands, as specified
in the @file{texmf.cnf} configuration file.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Unrestricted shell escapes are allowed if the option
@option{--shell-escape} is specified, or if the environment variable
or config file value @code{shell_escape} is set to @samp{t} or
@samp{y} and @samp{1}.

@item
Restricted shell escapes are allowed if @code{shell_escape} is set to
@samp{p}.  This is the default.

@item
Shell escapes are completely disabled if @option{--no-shell-escape} is
specified, or if @code{shell_escape} is set to anything else.
@end itemize

When enabled, the @TeX{} construct to execute a system command is
@code{\write18@{@var{shell-command}@}}; for example:

@example
\write18@{echo "hello, world"@}
@end example

@findex \output @r{routine, and @code{\write}}
From @TeX{}'s point of view, this is a normal @code{\write} command,
and is therefore subject to the usual @TeX{} expansions.  Also, the
system call either happens during the @samp{\output} routine or right
away, according to the absence or presence of the @code{\immediate}
prefix, as usual for @code{\write}.

@cindex exit status, of shell escape
The @var{shell-command} string is passed to the command shell (via the
C library function @code{system}).  The output of @var{shell-command}
is not diverted anywhere, so it will not appear in the log file, or
anywhere but the terminal output.  The exit status of the system call
is also not available to @TeX{}.

In unrestricted mode, the argument is simply passed straight to
@code{system} unaltered.

In restricted mode, ASCII double quote characters (@verb{|"|}) should
always be used in the argument to @code{\write18} where quoting of
arguments is needed, as in the example above.  This is to achieve some
measure of system independence.  On Unix systems, these are replaced
with single quote (@verb{|'|}) characters to avoid insecure further
expansion.  Care is also taken on Windows to avoid additional
expansions (from, e.g., @verb{|`...`|}).  Mismatched quotation marks
in the command string result in a diagnostic message in the log file;
no execution is performed.

@findex shell_escape_commands
After quotation processing, if the first word (delimited by a space or
tab) of the command is in the list specified by the
@code{shell_escape_commands} configuration value, the command is
executed.  Otherwise it is not.  In any case, a message is written to
the log file.

The @code{shell_escape_commands} value is a comma-separated list of
words.  Whitespace is significant, and typically should not be
present.  The default definition in @file{texmf.cnf} looks like this,
but with more commands included:

@example
shell_escape_commands = bibtex,kpsewhich,repstopdf,...
@end example

@cindex pipes, reading and writing
@findex \openin@r{, and pipes}
@findex \input@r{, and pipes}
@findex \openout@r{, and pipes}
@findex \pdfshellescape
pdf@TeX{} and lua@TeX{} support reading (via @code{\input} and
@code{\openin}) and writing (via @code{\openout}) from pipes if the
first character is @samp{|}.  The following command is then treated
exactly the same as the argument to @code{\write18}.  In these
engines, the primitive variable @code{\pdfshellescape} is set to 0 if
shell escapes are disabled, 1 if they are enabled, and 2 if they are
enabled with restrictions.

@cindex web environments, and security
The purpose of this feature is to make it possible for @TeX{}
documents to perform useful external actions in the common case of an
individual user running a known document on his or her own machine.
In such environments as CGI scripts or wikis where the input has to be
considered untrustworthy, shell escapes should be completely disabled.

Metafont is a system for producing shapes; it was designed for producing
complete typeface families, but it can also produce geometric designs,
dingbats, etc.  And it has considerable mathematical and
equation-solving capabilities which can be useful entirely on their own.

Metafont is a batch language, like C or Pascal: you compile a Metafont
program into a corresponding font, rather than interactively drawing
lines or curves.  This approach has both considerable disadvantages
(people unfamiliar with conventional programming languages will be
unlikely to find it usable) and considerable advantages (you can make
your design intentions specific and parameterizable).  For a complete
description of the Metafont language, see @cite{The METAFONTbook}
(@pxref{References}).

@node mf invocation
@section @code{mf} invocation

@pindex mf
@cindex Metafont invocation

Metafont (usually invoked as @code{mf}) reads character definitions
specified in the Metafont programming language, and outputs the
corresponding font.  This section merely describes the options available
in the Web2c implementation.  For a complete description of the Metafont
language, see @cite{The Metafontbook} (@pxref{References}).

Metafont processes its command line and determines its memory dump
(base) file in a way exactly analogous to MetaPost and @TeX{}
(@pxref{tex invocation}, and @pxref{Memory dumps}).  Synopses:

@example
mf [@var{option}]@dots{} [@var{mfname}[.mf]] [@var{mf-commands}]
mf [@var{option}]@dots{} \@var{first-line}
mf [@var{option}]@dots{} &@var{base} @var{args}
@end example

Most commonly, a Metafont invocation looks like this:
@example
mf '\mode:=@var{mode}; mag:=@var{magnification}; input @var{mfname}'
@end example
@noindent
(The single quotes avoid unwanted interpretation by the shell.)

@flindex .mf
@cindex Metafont input files
@cindex EC fonts
@pindex mktexmf@r{, disabling}
Metafont searches the usual places for the main input file @var{mfname}
(@pxref{Supported file formats,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}), extending
@var{mfname} with @file{.mf} if necessary.  To see all the relevant
paths, set the environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to @samp{-1}
before running the program.  By default, Metafont runs an external
program named @file{mktexmf} to create any nonexistent Metafont source
files you input.  You can disable this at configure-time or runtime
(@pxref{mktex configuration,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  This is mostly
for the sake of the EC fonts, which can be generated at any size.

@flindex .@var{nnn}gf @r{generic fonts}
@flindex mfput
@cindex GF output
@cindex GF files, output by Metafont
@cindex PK files, not output by Metafont
Metafont writes the main GF output to the file
@file{@var{basemfname}.@var{nnn}gf}, where @var{nnn} is the font
resolution in pixels per inch, and @var{basemfname} is the basename of
@var{mfname}, or @samp{mfput} if no input file was specified.  A GF file
contains bitmaps of the actual character shapes.  Usually GF files are
converted immediately to PK files with GFtoPK (@pxref{gftopk
invocation}), since PK files contain equivalent information, but are
more compact.  (Metafont output in GF format rather than PK for only
historical reasons.)

@flindex .tfm @r{output}
@cindex TFM files, output by Metafont
Metafont also usually writes a metric file in TFM format to
@file{@var{basemfname}.tfm}.  A TFM file contains character dimensions,
kerns, and ligatures, and spacing parameters.  @TeX{} reads only this
@t{.tfm} file, not the GF file.

@cindex mode needed to run Metafont
@findex proof @r{mode}
@flindex 2602gf
@flindex .2602gf
The @var{mode} in the example command above is a name referring to a
device definition (@pxref{Modes}); for example, @code{localfont} or
@code{ljfour}.  These device definitions must generally be precompiled
into the base file.  If you leave this out, the default is @code{proof}
mode, as stated in @cite{The Metafontbook}, in which Metafont outputs at
a resolution of 2602@dmn{dpi}; this is usually not what you want.  The
remedy is simply to assign a different mode---@code{localfont}, for
example.

The @var{magnification} assignment in the example command above is a
magnification factor; for example, if the device is 600@dmn{dpi} and you
specify @code{mag:=2}, Metafont will produce output at 1200@dmn{dpi}.
Very often, the @var{magnification} is an expression such as
@code{magstep(.5)}, corresponding to a @TeX{} ``magstep'', which are
factors of
@tex
1.2$\sqrt{2}$.
@end tex
@ifinfo
1.2 * sqrt(2).
@end ifinfo

After running Metafont, you can use the font in a @TeX{} document as
usual.  For example:
@example
\font\myfont = newfont
\myfont Now I am typesetting in my new font (minimum hamburgers).
@end example

The program accepts the following options, as well as the standard
@samp{-help} and @samp{-version} (@pxref{Common options}):
@table @samp
@item -[no]-file-line-error
@itemx -fmt=@var{fmtname}
@itemx -halt-on-error
@itemx -ini
@itemx -interaction=@var{string}
@itemx -jobname=@var{string}
@itemx -kpathsea-debug=@var{number}
@itemx -[no]parse-first-line
@itemx -output-directory
@itemx -progname=@var{string}
@itemx -recorder
@itemx -translate-file=@var{tcxfile}
@itemx -8bit
These options are common to @TeX{}, Metafont, and MetaPost.
@xref{Common options}.

@item -mktex=@var{filetype}
@itemx -no-mktex=@var{filetype}
@opindex -mktex=@var{filetype}
@opindex -no-mktex=@var{filetype}

@file{cmmf.base} (a.k.a.@: @file{cm.base}), with the Computer Modern
macros also included in the base file.  Nowadays, however, the
additional time required to read @file{cmbase.mf} is exceedingly small,
usually not enough to be worth the administrative hassle of updating the
@file{cmmf.base} file when you install a new version of @file{modes.mf}.
@cindex type design, personal
People actually working on a typeface may still find it worthwhile to
create their own base file, of course.


@node Modes
@section Modes: Device definitions for Metafont

@cindex modes file needed for Metafont
@cindex base files, need mode definitions
@cindex device definitions, for Metafont
@cindex printer characteristics, for Metafont
Running Metafont and creating Metafont base files requires information
that @TeX{} and MetaPost do not: @dfn{mode} definitions which specify
device characteristics, so Metafont can properly rasterize the shapes.

@flindex modes.mf @r{recommended modes file}
When making a base file, a file containing modes for locally-available
devices should be input after @file{plain.mf}.  One commonly used file
is @url{ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/modes.mf}; it includes all known
definitions.

@cindex small Metafont memory and modes
@findex mode_def
@findex mode_setup
If, however, for some reason you have decreased the memory available in
your Metafont, you may need to copy @file{modes.mf} and remove the
definitions irrelevant to you (probably most of them) instead of using
it directly.  (Or, if you're a Metafont hacker, maybe you can suggest a
way to redefine @code{mode_def} and/or @code{mode_setup}; right now, the
amount of memory used is approximately four times the total length of
the @code{mode_def} names, and that's a lot.)

If you have a device not included in @file{modes.mf}, please see
comments in that file for how to create the new definition, and please
send the definition to @email{tex-fonts@@math.utah.edu} to get it included
in the next release of @file{modes.mf}.

@findex smode @r{and dynamic Metafont mode definition}
@cindex dynamic Metafont mode definitions with @code{smode}
Usually, when you run Metafont you must supply the name of a mode that
was dumped in the base file.  But you can also define the mode
characteristics dynamically, by invoking Metafont with an assignment to
@code{smode} instead of @code{mode}, like this:
@example
mf '\smode:="newmode.mf"; mag:=@var{magnification}; input @var{mfname}'
@end example
@noindent
This is most useful when you are working on the definition of a new
mode.

The @var{magnification} and @var{mfname} arguments are explained in
@ref{mf invocation}.  In the file @file{newmode.mf}, you should have the
following (with no @code{mode_def} or @code{enddef}), if you are using
@file{modes.mf} conventions:
@example
mode_param (pixels_per_inch, @var{dpi});
mode_param (blacker, @var{b});
mode_param (fillin, @var{f});
mode_param (o_correction, @var{o});
mode_common_setup_;
@end example
@noindent
(Of course, you should use real numbers for @var{dpi}, @var{b}, @var{f},
and @var{o}.)

For more information on the use of @code{smode}, or if you are not using
@file{modes.mf}, see page 269 of @cite{The Metafontbook}.

@cindex online Metafont graphics
@cindex Metafont graphics

The Web2c implementation of Metafont can do online graphics with a
number of devices. (See the Metafont manual for more information about
how to draw on your screen.)  By default, no graphics support is
enabled.

@vindex MFTERM
@vindex TERM
Metafont examines the @code{MFTERM} environment variable or config file
value at runtime, or the @code{TERM} environment variable if
@code{MFTERM} is not set, to determine the device support to use.
Naturally, only the devices for which support has been compiled in can
be selected.

Here is a table of the possibilities, showing the @code{MFTERM} value
and the corresponding @code{configure} option(s) in parentheses.

EPS file containing the graphics which would be displayed online on
other devices. The name of the EPS file defaults to metafont.eps but
can be changed by setting the MFEPSF environment variable to the new
filename.  Contributed by Mathias Herberts.

You cannot specify any of the usual X options (e.g., @samp{-geometry})
on the Metafont command line, but you can specify X resources in your
@file{~/.Xdefaults} or @file{~/.Xresources} file. The class name is
@code{Metafont}. If you're using the Xt support, all the usual X toolkit
resources are supported.  If you're using the Xlib support, only the
@code{geometry} resource is supported.

@vindex DISPLAY
You specify the X display to which Metafont connects in the
@code{DISPLAY} environment variable, as usual.

Writing support for a new device is straightforward. Aside from defining
the basic drawing routines that Metafont uses (see @file{mf.web}), you
only have to add another entry to the tables on the last page of
@file{web2c/lib/texmfmp.c}.  Or you can write an independent program and
use MFtalk (see @file{web2c/window/mftalk.c}).


@node gftodvi invocation
@section GFtoDVI: Character proofs of fonts

@pindex gftodvi
@cindex character proofs of fonts
@cindex font proofs
@cindex proof sheets, of fonts

GFtoDVI makes @dfn{proof sheets} from a GF bitmap file as output by, for
example, Metafont (@pxref{Metafont}).  This is an indispensable aid for
font designers or Metafont hackers.  Synopsis:

@example
gftodvi [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{gfname}[gf]
@end example

The font @var{gfname} is searched for in the usual places (@pxref{Glyph
lookup,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  To see all the relevant paths, set the
environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to @samp{-1} before running
the program.

The suffix @samp{gf} is supplied if not already present.  This suffix is
not an extension, no @samp{.} precedes it; for instance, @file{cmr10.600gf}.

The output filename is the basename of @var{gfname} extended with
@file{.dvi}, e.g., @samp{gftodvi /wherever/foo.600gf} creates
@file{./foo.dvi}.

The characters from @var{gfname} appear one per page in the DVI output,
with labels, titles, and annotations, as specified in Appendix H
(Hardcopy Proofs) of @cite{The Metafontbook}.

GFtoDVI uses several fonts besides @var{gfname} itself:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex gray font
@dfn{gray font} (default @file{gray}): for the pixels that actually make
up the character.  Simply using black is not right, since then labels,
key points, and other information could not be shown.

@item
@cindex title font
@dfn{title font} (default @file{cmr8}): for the header information at
the top of each output page.

@item
@cindex label font
@dfn{label font} (default @file{cmtt10}): for the labels on key points
of the figure.

@item
@cindex slant font
@dfn{slant font} (no default): for diagonal lines, which are otherwise
simulated using horizontal and vertical rules.
@end itemize

To change the default fonts, you must use @code{special} commands in
your Metafont source file, typically via commands like @code{slantfont
slantlj4}.  There is no default slant font since no one printer is
suitable as a default.  You can make your own by copying one of the
existing files, such as
@file{.../fonts/source/public/misc/slantlj4.mf} and then running
@command{mf} on it.

For testing purposes, you may it useful to run @code{mf-nowin rtest}
(hit RETURN when it stops) to get a @file{gf} file of a thorn glyph.
Or use @command{mf} instead of @command{mf-nowin} to have the glyph(s)
displayed on the screen.  After that, @code{gftodvi rtest.2602gf}
should produce @file{rtest.dvi}, which you process as usual.

The program accepts the following option, as well as the standard
@samp{-verbose}, @samp{-help}, and @samp{-version} (@pxref{Common
options}):

@table @samp
@item -overflow-label-offset=@var{points}
@opindex -overflow-label-offset=@var{points}
@cindex overflow label offset
@cindex offset for overflow labels
Typeset the so-called overflow labels, if any, @var{points} @TeX{}
points from the right edge of the character bounding box.  The default
is a little over two inches (ten million scaled points, to be precise).
Overflow equations are used to locate coordinates when their actual
position is too crowded with other information.

@cindex @TeX{}, creating from Metafont

@flindex mftmac.tex
MFT translates a Metafont program into a @TeX{} document suitable for
typesetting, with the aid of @TeX{} macros defined in the file
@file{mftmac.tex}.  Synopsis:

@example
mft [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{mfname}[.mf]
@end example

MFT searches the usual places for @var{mfname} (@pxref{Supported file
formats,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  To see all the relevant paths, set the
environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to @samp{-1} before running
the program.  The output goes to the basename of @var{mfname} extended
with @file{.tex}, e.g., @samp{mft /wherever/foo.mf} creates
@file{./foo.tex}.

Line breaks in the input are carried over into the output; moreover,
blank spaces at the beginning of a line are converted to quads of
indentation in the output. Thus, you have full control over the
indentation and line breaks. Each line of input is translated
independently of the others.

Further control is allowed via Metafont comments:
@cindex comments, MFT control
@itemize @bullet
@item
Metafont comments following a single @samp{%} should be valid @TeX{}
input.  But Metafont material can be included within vertical bars in a
comment; this will be translated by MFT as if it were regular Metafont
code.  For example, a comment like @samp{% |x2r| is the tip of the bowl}
will be translated into the @TeX{} @samp{% $x_@{2r@}$ is the @dots{}},
i.e., the @samp{x2r} is treated as an identifier.

@item 
@samp{%%} indicates that the remainder of an input line should be copied
verbatim to the output.  This is typically used to introduce additional
@TeX{} material at the beginning or an MFT job, e.g. code to modify the
standard layout or the formatting macros defined in @file{mftmac.tex},
or to add a line saying @samp{%%\bye} at the end of the job.  (MFT
doesn't add this automatically in order to allow processing several
files produces by MFT in the same @TeX{} job.)

@item
@samp{%%% @var{token1} @var{other-tokens}}
introduces a change in MFT's formatting rules; all the @var{other-tokens}
will henceforth be translated according to the current conventions for
@var{token1}. The tokens must be symbolic (i.e., not
numeric or string tokens). For example, the input line
@example
%%% addto fill draw filldraw
@end example
@noindent
says to format the @samp{fill}, @samp{draw}, and @samp{filldraw}
operations of plain Metafont just like the primitive token @samp{addto},
i.e., in boldface type.  Without such reformatting commands, MFT would
treat @samp{fill} like an ordinary tag or variable name.  In fact, you
need a @samp{%%%} command even to get parentheses to act like
delimiters.

@item
@samp{%%%%} introduces an MFT comment, i.e., MFT ignores the remainder
of such a line.

@item
Five or more @samp{%} signs should not be used.

@cindex MetaPost invocation

@flindex mpman.ps
MetaPost (installed as @code{mpost}) reads a series of pictures
specified in the MetaPost programming language, and outputs
corresponding PostScript code.  This section merely describes the
options available in the Web2c implementation.  For a complete
description of the MetaPost language, see AT&T technical report
CSTR-162, generally available in @file{@var{texmf}/doc/metapost/},
where @var{texmf} is the root of @TeX{} directory structure.  See

@flindex mpgraph.ps
Also, a standard MetaPost package for drawing graphs is documented in
AT&T technical report CSTR-164, available as the file @file{mpgraph.ps},
generally stored alongside @file{mpman.ps}.

MetaPost processes its command line and determines its memory dump (mem)
file in a way exactly analogous to Metafont and @TeX{} (@pxref{tex
invocation,,@code{tex} invocation}, and @pxref{Memory dumps}).
Synopses:

@example
mpost [@var{option}]@dots{} [@var{mpname}[.mp]] [@var{mp-commands}]
mpost [@var{option}]@dots{} \@var{first-line}
mpost [@var{option}]@dots{} &@var{mem} @var{args}
@end example

@flindex .mp
@cindex MetaPost input files
MetaPost searches the usual places for the main input file @var{mpname}
(@pxref{Supported file formats,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}), extending
@var{mpname} with @file{.mp} if necessary.  To see all the relevant
paths, set the environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to @samp{-1}
before running the program.

@findex beginfig
@flindex .@var{nnn} @r{PostScript figures}
@flindex .tfm @r{output}
@flindex mpout
@cindex TFM files, output by MetaPost
@cindex PostScript output
MetaPost writes its PostScript output to a series of files
@file{@var{basempname}.@var{nnn}} (or perhaps
@file{@var{basempname}.ps}, very occasionally
@file{@var{basempname}.tfm}), where @var{nnn} are the figure numbers
specified in the input, typically to the @code{beginfig} macro, and
@var{basempname} is the basename of @var{mpname}, or @samp{mpout} if no
input file was specified.  MetaPost uses the @samp{.ps} extension when
the figure number is out of range, e.g., if you say @code{beginfig(-1)}.

You can use the output files as figures in a @TeX{} document just as
with any other PostScript figures. For example, with this @TeX{} command:
@example
\special@{psfile="@var{filename}"@}
@end example
@noindent
or by using @file{epsf.tex} (@pxref{EPSF macros,,, dvips, Dvips}).

@findex btex @r{for MetaPost labels}
@findex etex @r{for MetaPost labels}
The MetaPost construct
@example
btex @dots{} @var{tex-input} @dots{} etex
@end example
@noindent
generates a MetaPost picture expression corresponding to
@var{tex-input}.

The construct
@example
verbatimtex @dots{} @var{tex-input} @dots{} etex
@end example
@noindent
simply passes the @var{tex-input} through to
@TeX{}. For example, if you are using @LaTeX{}, your MetaPost input file
must start with a @code{verbatimtex} block that gives the necessary
@code{\documentclass} (or @code{\documentstyle})
@code{\begin@{document@}} command.  You will also need to set the
enviroment variable @code{TEX} to @samp{latex}.

@var{tex-input} need not be specifically @TeX{} input; it could also be
Troff.  In that case, you will need the @samp{-m pictures} Troff macro
package (unfortunately absent from many Troff implementations), or an
equivalent such as the @samp{-m pspic} macros from GNU groff described
in grops(1).

@cindex PostScript fonts, and Troff
@cindex Troff, and MetaPost
@cindex Computer Modern fonts, and Troff
Naturally, you must use fonts that are supported by the typesetter;
specifically, you'll probably want to use standard PostScript fonts with
Troff.  And only the @TeX{} system understands Computer Modern or other
Metafont fonts; you can also use PostScript fonts with @TeX{}, of course.

@flindex mproof.tex
@cindex downloading of fonts for MetaPost labels
@cindex font downloading for MetaPost labels
MetaPost-generated PostScript figures which do use Computer Modern fonts
for labels cannot be directly previewed or printed.  Instead, you must
include them in a @TeX{} document and run the resulting DVI file through
Dvips to arrange for the downloading of the required fonts (@pxref{Fonts
in figures,,, dvips, Dvips}).  To help with this, the MetaPost
distribution provides a small @TeX{} file @file{mproof.tex} which is
typically called as:
@example
tex mproof @var{mp-output-files}... ; dvips mproof -o
@end example
@noindent
The resulting file @file{mproof.ps} can then be printed or previewed.

@vindex prologues@r{, and EPSF output}
@flindex psfonts.map@r{, read by MetaPost}
To generate EPSF files, set the internal MetaPost variable
@code{prologues} positive.  To make the output files self-contained, use
only standard PostScript fonts.  MetaPost reads the same
@file{psfonts.map} file as Dvips, to determine PostScript fonts that
need to be downloaded (@pxref{psfonts.map,,, dvips, Dvips}).

@cindex PDF, and @code{.mps} files
@cindex @code{.mps} files and PDF
It is posible for pdf@TeX{} to read MetaPost output directly; this is
in contrast to general EPSF files, which have to be converted for use
with PDF output.  The easiest way is to name the MetaPost output files
with the @code{.mps} extension.  Then the @LaTeX{}
@code{\includegraphics} command, for example, will be able to read
them, even when outputting PDF.

@cindex security, and @code{write}
MetaPost can write output files, via the @code{write} primitive; this
opens a security hole.  @xref{tex invocation}.

The program accepts the following options, as well as the standard
@samp{-help} and @samp{-version} (@pxref{Common options}):

The output goes to the basename of @var{auxfile} extended with
@file{.bbl}; for example, @samp{bibtex /wherever/foo.aux} creates
@file{./foo.bbl}.  Bib@TeX{} also writes a log file to the basename of
@var{auxfile} extended with @samp{.blg}.

@findex \bibliography
@findex \bibliographystyle
@vindex TEXBIB@r{, search path for bib files}
@vindex BIBINPUTS@r{, search path for bib files}
@vindex BSTINPUTS@r{, search path for bst files}
The names of the @file{.bib} and @file{.bst} files are specified in the
@file{.aux} file as well, via the @file{\bibliography} and
@file{\bibliographystyle} (La)@TeX{} macros.  Bib@TeX{} searches for
@file{.bib} files using the @code{BIBINPUTS} and @code{TEXBIB} paths,
and for @file{.bst} files using @code{BSTINPUTS} (@pxref{Supported file
formats,,,kpathsea,Kpathsea}).  It does no path searching for
@file{.aux} files.

The program accepts the following options, as well as the standard
@samp{-help} and @samp{-version} (@pxref{Common options}):
@table @samp
@item -terse
@opindex -terse
@cindex terse output
@cindex verbose Bib@TeX{} output, suppressing
Suppress the program banner and progress reports normally output.

@item -min-crossrefs=@var{n}
@opindex -min-crossrefs=@var{n}
@cindex cross-referenced bibliography items
@cindex bibliography items, cross-referenced
If at least @var{n} (2 by default) bibliography entries refer to another
entry @var{e} via their @code{crossref} field, include @var{e} in the
@t{.bbl} file, even if it was not explicitly referenced in the @t{.aux}
file. For example, @var{e} might be a conference proceedings as a whole,
with the cross-referencing entries being individual articles published
in the proceedings.

If you want to avoid these automatic inclusions altogether, make
@var{n} a sufficiently large number, and be sure to remove any
previous @t{.aux} and @t{.bbl} files.  Otherwise the option may
appear to have no effect, since Bib@TeX{} will have added the citation
for @var{e} to the @t{.aux}, and nothing will remove it.

@cindex literate programming

@dfn{WEB} languages allow you to write a single source file that can
produce both a compilable program and a well-formatted document
describing the program in as much detail as you wish to prepare.
Writing in this kind of dual-purpose language is called @dfn{literate
programming}.  (The Usenet newsgroup @file{comp.programming.literate}
is devoted to this subject.)

@flindex webman.tex
@cindex Spiderweb
@cindex Cweb

@cindex Troff, WEB for
WEB-like languages have been implemented with many pairs of base
languages: Cweb provides C and Troff (@pxref{References}); CWEB provides
C and @TeX{} (@file{@var{CTAN:}/web/c_cpp/cweb}); Spiderweb provides C,
C++, Awk, Ada, many others, and @TeX{}
(@file{@var{CTAN:}/web/spiderweb}); and, of course, the original WEB
provides Pascal and @TeX{}, the implementation languages for the
original @TeX{}, Metafont, MetaPost, and related programs to come from
the @TeX{} project at Stanford.

The original WEB language is documented in the file @file{webman.tex},
which is included in the @url{ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/lib.tar.gz} archive
(and available in many other places, of course).

@node tangle invocation
@section Tangle: Translate WEB to Pascal

@pindex tangle
@cindex Pascal, creating from WEB
@cindex WEB programs, compiling

Tangle creates a compilable Pascal program from a WEB source file
(@pxref{WEB}).  Synopsis:

@example
tangle [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{webfile}[.web] [@var{changefile}[.ch]]
@end example

@cindex change files, and Tangle
@noindent
The Pascal output is written to the basename of @var{webfile} extended
with @samp{.p}; for example, @samp{tangle /wherever/foo.web} creates
@file{./foo.p}.  Tangle applies @var{changefile} to @var{webfile} before
writing the output; by default, there is no change file.

@cindex pool file, writing
@cindex string pool, writing
If the program makes use of the WEB string facility, Tangle writes the
string pool to the basename of @var{webfile} extended with @samp{.pool}.

The Pascal output is packed into lines of 72 characters or less, with
the only concession to readability being the termination of lines at
semicolons when this can be done conveniently.

The program accepts the following options, as well as the standard
@samp{--help} and @samp{--version} (@pxref{Common options}):

@table @samp
@item -length=@var{number}
@opindex -length=@var{number}
@cindex identifier length
The number of characters that are considered significant in an
identifier.  Whether underline characters are counted depends on the
@samp{-underline} option.  The default value is 32, the original tangle
used 7, but this proved too restrictive for use by Web2c.

@item -lowercase
@itemx -mixedcase
@itemx -uppercase
@opindex -lowercase
@opindex -mixedcase
@opindex -uppercase
@cindex identifier case
These options specify the case of identifiers in the output of tangle.
If @samp{-uppercase} (@samp{-lowercase}) is specified, tangle will
convert all identfiers to uppercase (lowercase).  The default is
@samp{-mixedcase}, which specifies that the case will not be changed.

@item -underline
@opindex -underline
@cindex identifiers with underlines
When this option is given, tangle does not strip underline characters
from identifiers.

@item -loose
@itemx -strict
@opindex -loose
@opindex -strict
@cindex identifier collisions
These options specify how strict tangle must be when checking
identifiers for equality.  The default is @samp{-loose}, which means
that tangle will follow the rules set by the case-smashing and underline
options above.  If @samp{-strict} is set, then identifiers will always
be stripped of underlines and converted to uppercase before checking
whether they collide.

@node weave invocation
@section Weave: Translate WEB to @TeX{}

@pindex weave
@cindex @TeX{}, creating from WEB
@cindex WEB programs, typesetting
@cindex prettyprinting WEB programs

Weave creates a @TeX{} document from a WEB source file (@pxref{WEB}),
assuming various macros defined in @file{webmac.tex}.   It takes care of
typographic details such as page layout, indentation, and italicizing
identifiers.  It also automatically gathers and outputs extensive
cross-reference information.  Synopsis:

@example
weave [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{webfile}[.web] [@var{changefile}[.ch]]
@end example

@cindex change files, and Weave
@noindent
The output is to the basename of @var{webfile} extended with
@samp{.tex}; for example, @samp{weave /wherever/foo.web} creates
@file{./foo.tex}.  Weave applies @var{changefile} to @var{webfile}
before writing the output; by default, there is no change file.

The program accepts the following option, as well as the standard
@samp{-verbose}, @samp{-help} and @samp{-version} (@pxref{Common
options}):
@table @samp
@item -x
@opindex -x
@cindex cross-references, omitting
@flindex CONTENTS.tex
@flindex webmac.tex
Omit the cross-reference information: the index, the list of WEB module
names, and the table of contents (an empty @file{CONTENTS.tex} file will
still be written when the Weave output file is processed by @TeX{} using
the default @file{webmac.tex}, though).
@end table

Conventionally, WEB programmers should define the @TeX{} @code{\title}
macro at the beginning of the source file.  Also, to get output of only
changed modules, one can say @code{\let\maybe=\iffalse} (usually as the
first change in the change file).


@node pooltype invocation
@section Pooltype: Display WEB pool files

@pindex pooltype

@cindex string numbers, displaying
@cindex WEB pool files, displaying

Pooltype shows the so-called @dfn{string number} of each string in a WEB
pool file (@pxref{WEB}), as output by Tangle (@pxref{tangle
invocation}), including the first 256 strings corresponding to the
possible input characters.  Pooltype primarily serves as an example of
WEB conventions to implementors of the @TeX{} system.  Synopsis:

@example
pooltype [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{poolfile}[.pool]
@end example

@noindent
No path searching is done for @var{poolfile}.  Output is to standard
output.

The only options are @samp{--help} and @samp{--version} (@pxref{Common
options}).

As an example of the output, here is the (edited) output for @file{tex.pool}:
@example
0: "^^@@"
1: "^^A"
@dots{}
255: "^^ff"
256: "pool size"
@dots{}
1314: "Using character substitution: "
(23617 characters in all.)
@end example

@cindex representation of strings
@cindex string representation
In Metafont and MetaPost, the first 256 characters are actually
represented as single bytes (i.e., themselves), not in the @samp{^^}
notation.  Consider Pooltype as showing the results after conversion for
output.


@node DVI utilities
@chapter DVI utilities

@cindex DVI utilities

@TeX{} outputs a file in @dfn{DVI} (DeVice Independent) format as a
compact representation of the original document.  DVI files can be
translated to meet the requirements of a real physical device, such as
PostScript printers (@pxref{Top,, Introduction, dvips, Dvips}), PCL
printers (see dvilj(1)), and X displays (see xdvi(1)).  In fact, DVI
translators are available for virtually all common devices: see
@file{@var{CTAN:}/dviware} (for CTAN info, @pxref{unixtex.ftp,,,
kpathsea, Kpathsea}).

@flindex dvitype.web
@cindex DVI format definition

@node dvicopy invocation
@section DVIcopy: Canonicalize virtual font references

@pindex dvicopy
@cindex virtual fonts, expanding

DVIcopy reads a DVI file, expands any references to virtual fonts
(@pxref{Virtual fonts,,, dvips, Dvips}) to base fonts, and writes the
resulting DVI file.  Thus you can use virtual fonts even if your DVI
processor does not support them, by passing the documents through
DVIcopy first.  Synopsis:

@example
dvicopy [@var{option}]@dots{} [@var{indvi}[.dvi] [@var{outdvi}[.dvi]]]
@end example

DVIcopy reads standard input if @var{indvi} is not specified, and writes
standard output if @var{outdvi} is not specified.

The program accepts the following options, as well as the standard
@samp{-help} and @samp{-version} (@pxref{Common options}):
@table @samp
@item -magnification=@var{integer}
@opindex -magnification=@var{integer}
@cindex magnification
@findex \mag

specifies no magnification.  This is equivalent to setting @TeX{}'s
@code{\mag} parameter.

@item -max-pages=@var{n}

DVItype translates a DeVice Independent (DVI) file (as output by @TeX{},
for example) to a plain text file that humans can read.  It also serves
as a DVI-validating program, i.e., if DVItype can read a file, it's
correct.  Synopsis:

@example
dvitype [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{dvifile}[.dvi]
@end example

@noindent
DVItype does not read any bitmap files, but it does read TFM files for
fonts referenced in @var{dvifile}.  The usual places are searched
(@pxref{Supported file formats,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  To see all the
relevant paths, set the environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to
@samp{-1} before running the program.

Output goes to standard output.

@node Font file formats
@section Font file formats

@cindex font file formats
@cindex file formats for fonts

(For another perspective on this, @pxref{Font concepts,,, dvips,
Dvips}).

Font files come in several varieties, with suffixes like:
@example
.tfm  .*pk  .*gf  .*pxl@r{ (obsolete)}  .pl  .mf  .vf  .vpl
@end example
@noindent
Each represents a file format.

@cindex TFM files, explained
A TFM (@TeX{} font metric) file is a compact binary file that contains
information about each character in a font, about combinations of
characters within that font, and about the font as a whole.  The font
metric information contained in TFM files is device-independent units is
used by @TeX{} to do typesetting.  Unlike the bitmap (raster) fonts
described below, TFM font files contain no information about the shapes
of characters.  They describe rectangular areas and combinations
thereof, but not what will eventually be printed in those areas.

@cindex scaling of fonts
@cindex optical font scaling
@cindex geometric font scaling
@cindex PostScript, and font scaling
Since @TeX{} does scaling calculations, one TFM file serves for all
magnifications of a given typeface.  On the other hand, the best printed
results are obtained when magnified (or reduced fonts) are not produced
geometrically (as done by PostScript, for example) but rather optically,
with each size a separate design (as done with Computer Modern and the
EC fonts, for example); then a separate TFM file is needed for each
size.

@cindex DVI files, explained
At any rate, @TeX{} produces a DVI (DeVice Independent) file from your
source document.  In order to print DVI files on real devices, you need
font files defining digitized character shapes and other data.  Then
previewers and printer-driver programs can translate your DVI files into
something usable by your monitor or printer.  Bitmap fonts come with
suffixes such as @samp{.600pk} or @samp{.600gf} or @samp{.3000pxl}, where
the @samp{600} is the horizontal dots-per-inch resolution at which the
font was produced, and the @samp{pk} or @samp{gf} or @samp{pxl}
indicates the font format.  Outline fonts in PostScript Type 1 format
have suffixes such as @samp{.pfa} or @samp{.pfb}.

@cindex PXL files, explained
@cindex PK files, explained
@cindex GF files, explained
Fonts in pk (packed) format are in the tightly packed raster format that
is pretty much the standard today.  They take up less space than fonts
in the gf (generic font) format that Metafont generates, and far less
space than fonts in pxl format.  Fonts in pxl format take up gross
amounts of disk space and permit only 128 characters.  They are
obsolete.

@cindex PL files, explained
Font files with the @samp{.pl} (property list) suffix are the plain text
(human-readable) analog of the binary @samp{.tfm} files.  
The TFtoPL and PLtoTF programs convert between the two formats
(@pxref{tftopl invocation} and @ref{pltotf invocation}).

Font files with the @samp{.mf} suffix are in Metafont source format.
These are the files used by Metafont to generate rastered fonts for
specific typefaces at specific magnifications for the specific
resolution and type of mapping used by your device.

@flindex virtual-fonts.knuth
@flindex virtualfonts.txt
The suffix @samp{.vf} identifies ``virtual font'' files, for which
@samp{.vpl} is the human-readable analog.  See @xref{vftovp invocation},
and @ref{vptovf invocation}.  For further discussion of virtual fonts,
see @file{@var{CTAN:}/doc/virtual-fonts.knuth},

@section GFtoPK: Generic to packed font conversion

@pindex gftopk
@cindex conversion, GF to PK
@cindex PK, converting GF to
@cindex GF, converting to PK

GFtoPK converts a generic font (GF) file output by, for example,
Metafont (@pxref{mf invocation}) to a packed font (PK) file.  PK files
are considerably smaller than the corresponding gf files, so they are
generally the bitmap font format of choice.  Some DVI-processing
programs, notably Dvips, only support PK files and not GF files.
Synopsis:

@example
gftopk [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{gfname}.@var{dpi}[gf] [@var{pkfile}]
@end example

@noindent
The font @var{gfname} is searched for in the usual places (@pxref{Glyph
lookup,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  To see all the relevant paths, set the
environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to @samp{-1} before running
the program.

The suffix @samp{gf} is supplied if not already present.  This suffix is
not an extension; no @samp{.} precedes it: for instance,
@file{cmr10.600gf}.

If @var{pkfile} is not specified, the output is written to the basename
of @samp{@var{gfname}.@var{dpi}pk}, e.g., @samp{gftopk
/wherever/cmr10.600gf} creates @file{./cmr10.600pk}.

The only options are @samp{--verbose}, @samp{--help}, and
@samp{--version} (@pxref{Common options}).


@node pktogf invocation
@section PKtoGF: Packed to generic font conversion

@pindex pktogf
@cindex conversion, PK to GF
@cindex GF, converting PK to
@cindex PK, converting to GF

PKtoGF converts a packed font (PK) file to a generic font (GF) file.
Since PK format is much more compact than GF format, the most likely
reason to do this is to run GFtype (@pxref{gftype invocation}) on the
result, so you can see the bitmap images.  Also, a few old utility
programs do not support PK format.  Synopsis:

@example
pktogf [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{pkname}.@var{dpi}[pk] [@var{gffile}]
@end example

@noindent
The font @var{pkname} is searched for in the usual places (@pxref{Glyph
lookup,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  To see all the relevant paths, set the
environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to @samp{-1} before running
the program.

The suffix @samp{pk} is supplied if not already present.  This suffix is
not an extension; no @samp{.} precedes it: for instance,
@file{cmr10.600pk}.

If @var{gffile} is not specified, the output is written to the basename
of @samp{@var{pkname}.@var{dpi}gf}, e.g., @samp{pktogf
/wherever/cmr10.600pk} creates @file{./cmr10.600gf}.

PKtype translates a packed font (PK) bitmap file (as output by GFtoPK,
for example) to a plain text file that humans can read.  It also serves
as a PK-validating program, i.e., if PKtype can read a file, it's
correct.  Synopsis:

@noindent
Explanation:

@table @samp
@item 2033
@itemx 2043
@itemx @dots{}
@cindex byte position
The byte position in the file where each GF command starts.

@item beginning of char 75
@cindex character codes, in GFtype output
The character code, in decimal.

@item 3<=m<=60 0<=n<=56
@cindex left side bearing
@cindex right side bearing
@cindex side bearings
The character's bitmap lies between 3 and 60 (inclusive) horizontally,
and between 0 and 56 (inclusive) vertically. (@math{m} is a column
position and @math{n} is a row position.)  Thus, 3 is the left side
bearing.  The right side bearing is the horizontal escapement (given
below) minus the maximum @math{m}.

@item (initially n=56) paint (0)24(12)20
@cindex run length encoded bitmaps
The first row of pixels: 0 white pixels, 24 black pixels, 12 white
pixels, etc.

@item newrow 0 (n=55) paint 24(12)20
@findex newrow @r{GF command}
The second row of pixels, with zero leading white pixels on the row.

@item eoc
@findex eoc @r{GF command}
The end of the main character definition.

@end table

Here is the GF postamble information that GFtype outputs at the end:

@example

@cindex escapement, horizontal
@cindex vertical escapement
@cindex escapement, vertical
@cindex scaled pixels
@cindex dx @r{horizontal escapement}
@cindex dy @r{vertical escapement}
The device-dependent width, in @dfn{scaled pixels}, i.e., units of
horizontal pixels times 2^16.  The @samp{(65)} is simply the same number
rounded.  If the vertical escapement is nonzero, it would appear here as
a @samp{dy} value.

@item width
@cindex TFM width of characters
@cindex device-independent width
@cindex width, device-independent
The device-independent (TFM) width of this character.  It is 2^24
times the ratio of the true width to the font's design size.  The
@samp{64.57289} is the same number converted to pixels.

@item loc
The byte position in the file where this character starts.

@cindex conversion, TFM to property list
@cindex validation, of TFM files
@cindex property list, converting TFM to
@cindex human-readable text, converting TFM to
@cindex plain text, converting TFM to

TFtoPL translates a @TeX{} font metric (TFM, @pxref{Metric
files,,,dvips,Dvips}) file (as output by Metafont, for example) to
@dfn{property list format} (a list of parenthesized items describing the
font) that humans can edit or read.  This program is mostly used by
people debugging @TeX{} implementations, writing font utilities, etc.
Synopsis:

@example
tftopl [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{tfmname}[.tfm] [@var{plfile}[.pl]]
@end example

The font @var{tfmname} (extended with @samp{.tfm} if necessary) is
searched for in the usual places (@pxref{Supported file formats,,,
kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  To see all the relevant paths, set the
environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to @samp{-1} before running
the program.

If @var{plfile} (which is extended with @samp{.pl} if necessary) is not
specified, the property list file is written to standard output.  The
property list file can be converted back to TFM format by the companion
program TFtoPL (see the next section).

The program accepts the following option, as well as the standard
@samp{-verbose}, @samp{-help} and @samp{-version} (@pxref{Common
options}):
@table @samp
@item -charcode-format=@var{type}
@opindex -charcode-format=@var{type}
Output character codes in the PL file according to @var{type}: either
@samp{octal} or @samp{ascii}.  Default is @samp{ascii} for letters and
digits, octal for all other characters.  Exception: if the font's coding
scheme starts with @samp{TeX math sy} or @samp{TeX math ex}, all
character codes are output in octal.

In @samp{ascii} format, character codes that correspond to graphic
characters, except for left and right parentheses, are output as a
@samp{C} followed by the single character: @samp{C K}, for example.  In
octal format, character codes are output as the letter @samp{O} followed
by octal digits, as in @samp{O 113} for @samp{K}.

@samp{octal} format is useful for symbol and other non-alphabetic fonts,
where using ASCII characters for the character codes is merely
confusing.

@cindex property list format
As an example of the output, here is the (abridged) property list
translation of @file{cmr10.tfm}:

As you can see, the general format is a list of parenthesized
@dfn{properties}, nested where necessary.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@findex FAMILY @r{property}
@findex FACE @r{property}
@findex headerbyte @r{information}
The first few items (@code{FAMILY}, @code{FACE}, and so on) are
the so-called @dfn{headerbyte} information from Metafont, giving general
information about the font.

@item
@findex FAMILY @r{property}
@findex \fontdimen
The @code{FONTDIMEN} property defines the @TeX{} @code{\fontdimen}
values.

@item
@findex LIGTABLE @r{property}
@findex LABEL @r{property}
@findex LIG @r{property}
@findex KRN @r{property}
@cindex ligature table, in TFM files
@cindex kerning table, in TFM files
@cindex design-size units
The @code{LIGTABLE} property defines the ligature and kerning table.
@code{LIG} properties define ligatures: in the example above, an
@samp{f} (in the @samp{LABEL}) followed by an @samp{i} is a ligature,
i.e., a typesetting program like @TeX{} replaces those two consecutive
characters by the character at position octal '014 in the current
font---presumably the `fi' ligature.  @code{KRN} properties define
kerns: if an @samp{f} is followed by character octal '047 (an
apostrophe), @TeX{} inserts a small amount of space between them:
0.077779 times the design size the font was loaded at (about
three-quarters of a printer's point by default in this case, or .001
inches).

@item
@findex CHARACTER @r{property}
@findex CHARWD @r{property}
@findex CHARHT @r{property}
@findex CHARDP @r{property}
@findex CHARIC @r{property}
The @code{CHARACTER} property defines the dimensions of a character: its
width, height, depth, and italic correction, also in design-size units,
as explained in the previous item.  For our example `f', the depth is
zero, so that property is omitted.  TFtoPL also inserts any kerns and
ligatures for this character as a comment.

PLtoTF translates a property list file (as output by TFtoPL, for
example) to @TeX{} font metric (TFM, @pxref{Metric files,,,dvips,Dvips})
format.  It's much easier for both programs and humans to create the
(plain text) property list files and let PLtoTF take care of creating
the binary TFM equivalent than to output TFM files directly.  Synopsis:

@example
pltotf [@var{option}]@dots{} @var{plfile}[.pl] [@var{tfmfile}[.tfm]]
@end example

If @var{tfmfile} (extended with @samp{.tfm} if necessary) is
not specified, the TFM file is written to the basename of
@samp{@var{plfile}.tfm}, e.g., @samp{pltotf /wherever/cmr10.pl} creates
@file{./cmr10.tfm}.  (Since TFM files are binary, writing to standard

relevant paths, set the environment variable @code{KPATHSEA_DEBUG} to
@samp{-1} before running the program.  If @var{tfmname} is not
specified, @var{vfname} (without a trailing @samp{.vf}) is used.

If @var{vplfile} (extended with @samp{.vpl} if necessary) is
not specified, the property list file is written to standard output.
The property list file can be converted back to VF and TFM format by the
companion program VFtoVP (see the next section).

The program accepts the following option, as well as the standard
@samp{-verbose}, @samp{-help} and @samp{-version} (@pxref{Common
options}):
@table @samp
@item -charcode-format=@var{type}
@opindex -charcode-format=@var{type}
Output character codes in the PL file according to @var{type}: either
@samp{octal} or @samp{ascii}.  Default is @samp{ascii} for letters and
digits, octal for all other characters.  Exception: if the font's coding
scheme starts with @samp{TeX math sy} or @samp{TeX math ex}, all
character codes are output in octal.

In @samp{ascii} format, character codes that correspond to graphic

@samp{octal} format is useful for symbol and other non-alphabetic fonts,
where using ASCII characters for the character codes is merely
confusing.

@cindex copyright notices
@cindex permissions, legal

In general, each file has its own copyright notice stating the copying
permissions for that file.  Following is a summary.

The Stanford @TeX{} programs and Web2c system itself are in the public
domain (@url{https://tug.org/texlive/copying.html}).  The sources may
be copied verbatim, or used as the starting point of new software
under different names; however, per the wishes of the authors, they
should be modified only through a @file{.ch} file, but this is in the
nature of a development request rather than a legal requirement.

ML@TeX{}, pdf@TeX{}, Lua@TeX{}, Xe@TeX{}, and all the other derived
engines have used various license terms for their additions to the
base code, often the GPL (see @url{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/#GPL}
or (for example) the file @file{web2c/pdftexdir/COPYINGv2}. They also
mostly make use of additional libraries with their own (compatible)
terms. Please see each program's sources.

The Kpathsea library is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
License (@pxref{Introduction,,, kpathsea, Kpathsea}).  Therefore, the
@emph{binaries} resulting from a standard Web2c compilation are also
covered by the LGPL; so if you (re)distribute the binaries, you must
also (offer to) distribute the complete source that went into those
binaries.  See @url{https://gnu.org/licenses/#LGPL} or the file
@file{kpathsea/COPYING.LESSERv2}.
