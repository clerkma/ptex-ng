# We could test that it propagates to subprograms with something like
# tex -ini --shell-restricted '\catcode123=1 \catcode125=2 \immediate\write18{kpsewhich --var-value TEXMF_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}\end'
# but since it requires so much config file stuff, let's not bother.

# In theory we should run this with all the tex engines + mf,
# but it just doesn't seem worth the time or trouble.  After it's
# implemented in LuaTeX and MetaPost, would be worth it there since it's
# independent code.

# BibTeX requires implementing the output directory stuff; see bibtex.ch.
# If that's ever done, a test invocation, within the subshell above,
# could look like:
#  TEXMFCNF=$srcdir/../kpathsea \
#    BSTINPUTS=$srcdir/tests \
#    BIBINPUTS=$srcdir/tests \
#  $_bibtex $srcdir/tests/exampl.aux || exit 1
