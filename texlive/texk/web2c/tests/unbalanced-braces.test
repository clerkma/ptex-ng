This is (clearly) not an actual test file that can be run.
It exists to record some of the nefarious input files that caused the
problems that unbalanced-braces.ch tries to resolve.

% (From drf)
% Below is the only test file I didn't get directly from others; the thing
% I like about it is that it shows the case where the \extra token of the
% \output routine has been "backed_up" so it's no longer part of the
% output_text when we get to <Resume the page builder after an output
% routine has come to an end>.  (The parsing of "\box255" reads the
% following token, and sees it's not a digit, so pushes it back.) And if
% you remove the "\extra", you get the case where the actual right brace
% in the output routine is backed_up, which is legal and expected, so
% shouldn't be messed up by my changes.
