The e-TeX engine is an extended TeX developed under the auspices of the
NTS Group and implemented by Peter Breitenlohner (deceased 2015).
The extensions are enabled by a leading "*" character at initex time.

Further cross-engine extensions to TeX have been developed in the pdfTeX
and other engines, keeping e-TeX stable.

The "etex" executable provided in most distributions is an incarnation
of pdfTeX running in DVI mode, in order for those additional extensions
to also be available.

LaTeX requires the functionality of both e-TeX extensions and some of the
extensions beyond e-TeX.
