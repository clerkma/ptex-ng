You may freely use, modify and/or distribute this file.

This TeX Live directory contains the programs that use the kpathsea
library for configuration and path searching, and the library itself.

Some programs can be built on their own, but others, including kpathsea
itself, cannot.  Instead, try using the script ../../Build or the
equivalent configure && make. In general, for TeX Live we only test
configuring the whole tree.

Upstream sources and last-checked versions follow.  If a url is given,
that is the upstream, although this does not mean the program is
actively maintained.  Programs marked with a "?" are not (knowingly)
maintained here, but the upstream is unknown.  If a program is knowingly
maintained here in the TL repo, that is explicitly stated.

Anyone -- please research and update any of this information.
