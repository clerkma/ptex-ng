install-tl - TeX Live cross-platform installer

@node install-tl SYNOPSIS
@appendixsec SYNOPSIS

install-tl [@emph{option}]...

install-tl-windows.bat [@emph{option}]...

install-tl-advanced.bat [@emph{option}]...

@node install-tl DESCRIPTION
@appendixsec DESCRIPTION

This installer creates a runnable TeX Live installation from various
media, including over the network, from local hard disk, a DVD, etc.
The installer works across all platforms supported by TeX Live.  For
information on initially downloading the TeX Live, see
@url{http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html}.

The basic idea of TeX Live installation is for you to choose one of the
top-level @emph{schemes}, each of which is defined as a different set of
@emph{collections} and @emph{packages}, where a collection is a set of packages,
and a package is what contains actual files.

Within the installer, you can choose a scheme, and further customize the
set of collections to install, but not the set of the packages.  To work
at the package level, use @code{tlmgr} (reference just below) after the
initial installation is complete.

The default is @code{scheme-full}, which installs everything, and this is
highly recommended.

@node install-tl REFERENCES
@appendixsec REFERENCES

Post-installation configuration, package updates, and much more, are
handled through @strong{tlmgr}(1), the TeX Live Manager
(@url{http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html}).

The most up-to-date version of this installer documentation is on the
Internet at @url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html}.

For the full documentation of TeX Live, see
@url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc}.

@node install-tl OPTIONS
@appendixsec OPTIONS

As usual, all options can be specified in any order, and with either a
leading @code{-} or @code{--}.  An argument value can be separated from its
option by either a space or @code{=}.

@table @asis
@item @strong{-gui} [[=]@emph{module}]
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-gui} [[=]@emph{module}]}

If no @emph{module} is given, starts the @code{perltk} (see below) GUI installer.

If @emph{module} is given loads the given installer module. Currently the
following modules are supported:

@table @asis
@item @code{text}
@anchor{install-tl @code{text}}

The text mode user interface (default on Unix systems).  Same as the
@code{-no-gui} option.

@item @code{wizard}
@anchor{install-tl @code{wizard}}

The wizard mode user interface (default on Windows), asking only minimal
questions before installing all of TeX Live.

@item @code{perltk}
@anchor{install-tl @code{perltk}}

The expert GUI installer, providing access to more options.  
Can also be invoked on Windows by running @code{install-tl-advanced.bat}.

@end table

The @code{perltk} and @code{wizard} modules, and thus also when calling with
bare @code{-gui} (with no @emph{module}), require the Perl/Tk module
(@url{http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk}); if Perl/Tk is not
available, installation continues in text mode.

@item @strong{-no-gui}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-no-gui}}

Use the text mode installer (default except on Windows).

@item @strong{-lang} @emph{llcode}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-lang} @emph{llcode}}

By default, the GUI tries to deduce your language from the environment
(on Windows via the registry, on Unix via @code{LC_MESSAGES}). If that fails
you can select a different language by giving this option with a
language code (based on ISO 639-1).  Currently supported (but not
necessarily completely translated) are: English (en, default), Czech
(cs), German (de), French (fr), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Dutch (nl),
Polish (pl), Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR), Russian (ru), Slovak (sk),
Slovenian (sl), Serbian (sr), Ukrainian (uk), Vietnamese (vi),
simplified Chinese (zh_CN), and traditional Chinese (zh_TW).

@item @strong{-repository} @emph{url|path}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-repository} @emph{url|path}}

Specify the package repository to be used as the source of the
installation, either a local directory via @code{/path/to/directory} or a
@code{file:/} url, or a network location via a @code{http://}, @code{https://}, or
@code{ftp://} url.  (No other protocols are supported, and @code{https://} may
not work on all platforms.)

The default is to pick a mirror automatically, using
@url{http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet}; the chosen mirror is
used for the entire download.  You can use the special argument @code{ctan}
as an abbreviation for this.  See @url{http://ctan.org} for more about CTAN
and its mirrors.

If the repository is on the network, trailing @code{/} characters and/or
trailing @code{/tlpkg} and @code{/archive} components are ignored.  For example,
you could choose a particular CTAN mirror with something like this:

@verbatim
  -repository http://ctan.example.org/its/ctan/dir/systems/texlive/tlnet
@end verbatim

Of course a real hostname and its particular top-level CTAN directory
have to be specified.  The list of CTAN mirrors is available at
@url{http://ctan.org/mirrors}.

If the repository is local, the installation type (compressed or live) is
automatically determined, by checking for the presence of a
@code{archive} directory relative to the root.  Compressed is
preferred if both are available, since it is faster.  Here's an example
of using a local directory:

@verbatim
  -repository /local/TL/repository
@end verbatim

After installation is complete, you can use that installation as the
repository for another installation.  If you chose to install less than
the full scheme containing all packages, the list of available schemes
will be adjusted accordingly.

For backward compatibility and convenience, @code{--location} and @code{--repo}
are accepted as aliases for this option.

@item @strong{-select-repository}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-select-repository}}

This option allows manual selection of a mirror from the current list of
active CTAN mirrors.  This option is supported in all installer modes
(text, wizard, perltk), and will also offer to install from local media
if available, or from a repository specified on the command line (see
above).  It's useful when the (default) automatic redirection does not
choose a good host for you.

@item @strong{-all-options}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-all-options}}

Normally options not relevant to the current platform are not shown
(e.g., when running on Unix, Windows-specific options are omitted).
Giving this command line option allows configuring such "foreign"
settings.

@item @strong{-custom-bin} @emph{path}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-custom-bin} @emph{path}}

If you have built your own set of TeX Live binaries (perhaps because
your platform was not supported by TeX Live out of the box), this option
allows you to specify the @emph{path} to a directory where the binaries for
the current system are present.  The installation will continue as
usual, but at the end all files from @emph{path} are copied over to
@code{bin/custom/} under your installation directory and this @code{bin/custom/}
directory is what will be added to the path for the post-install
actions.  To install multiple custom binary sets, manually rename
@code{custom} before doing each.

For more information on custom binaries, see
@url{http://tug.org/texlive/custom-bin.html}.  For general information on
building TeX Live, see @url{http://tug.org/texlive/build.html}.

@item @strong{-debug-translation}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-debug-translation}}

In GUI mode, this switch makes @code{tlmgr} report any missing, or more
likely untranslated, messages to standard error.  Helpful for
translators to see what remains to be done.

@item @strong{-force-platform} @emph{platform}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-force-platform} @emph{platform}}

Instead of auto-detecting the current platform, use @emph{platform}.
Binaries for this platform must be present and they must actually be
runnable, or installation will fail.  @code{-force-arch} is a synonym.

@item @strong{-help}, @strong{--help}, @strong{-?}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-help}@comma{} @strong{--help}@comma{} @strong{-?}}

Display this help and exit.  (This help is on the web at
@url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html}).  Sometimes the
@code{perldoc} and/or @code{PAGER} programs on the system have problems,
possibly resulting in control characters being literally output.  This
can't always be detected, but you can set the @code{NOPERLDOC} environment
variable and @code{perldoc} will not be used.

@item @strong{-in-place}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-in-place}}

This is a quick-and-dirty installation option in case you already have
an rsync or svn checkout of TeX Live.  It will use the checkout as-is
and will just do the necessary post-install.  Be warned that the file
@code{tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb} may be rewritten, that removal has to be done
manually, and that the only realistic way to maintain this installation
is to redo it from time to time.  This option is not available via the
installer interfaces.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

@item @strong{-init-from-profile} @emph{profile_file}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-init-from-profile} @emph{profile_file}}

Similar to @strong{-profile} (see @ref{install-tl PROFILES,, PROFILES} below), but only initializes the
installation configuration from @emph{profile_file} and then starts the
interactive session.

@item @strong{-logfile} @emph{file}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-logfile} @emph{file}}

Write both all messages (informational, debugging, warnings) to @emph{file},
in addition to standard output or standard error.

If this option is not given, the installer will create a log file
in the root of the writable installation tree,
for example, @code{/usr/local/texlive/YYYY/install-tl.log} for the @emph{YYYY}
release.

@item @strong{-no-cls}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-no-cls}}

For the text mode installer only: do not clear the screen when entering
a new menu (for debugging purposes).

@item @strong{-non-admin}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-non-admin}}

For Windows only: configure for the current user, not for all users.

@item @strong{-persistent-downloads}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-persistent-downloads}}

@item @strong{-no-persistent-downloads}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-no-persistent-downloads}}

For network installs, activating this option makes the installer try to
set up a persistent connection using the @code{Net::LWP} Perl module.  This
opens only one connection between your computer and the server per
session and reuses it, instead of initiating a new download for each
package, which typically yields a significant speed-up.

This option is turned on by default, and the installation program will
fall back to using @code{wget} if this is not possible.  To disable usage of
LWP and persistent connections, use @code{-no-persistent-downloads}.

@item @strong{-no-verify-downloads}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-no-verify-downloads}}

By default, if a GnuPG @code{gpg} binary is found in PATH, downloads are
verified against a cryptographic signature. This option disables such
verification.  The full description is in the Crytographic Verification
section of the @code{tlmgr} documentation, e.g.,
@url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#CRYPTOGRAPHIC-VERIFICATION}

@item @strong{-portable}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-portable}}

Install for portable use, e.g., on a USB stick.  Also selectable from
within the perltk and text installers.

@item @strong{-print-platform}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-print-platform}}

Print the TeX Live identifier for the detected platform
(hardware/operating system) combination to standard output, and exit.
@code{-print-arch} is a synonym.

@item @strong{-profile} @emph{profile_file}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-profile} @emph{profile_file}}

Load @emph{profile_file} and do the installation with no user interaction,
that is, a batch (unattended) install.  See @ref{install-tl PROFILES,, PROFILES} below.

@item @strong{-q}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-q}}

Omit normal informational messages.

@item @strong{-scheme} @emph{scheme}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-scheme} @emph{scheme}}

Schemes are the highest level of package grouping in TeX Live; the
default is to use the @code{full} scheme, which includes everything.  This
option overrides that default.  You can change the scheme again before
the actual installation with the usual menu.  The @emph{scheme} argument may
optionally have a prefix @code{scheme-}.  The list of supported scheme names
depends on what your package repository provides; see the interactive
menu list.

@item @strong{-v}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-v}}

Include verbose debugging messages; repeat for maximum debugging: @code{-v
-v}.  (Further repeats are accepted but ignored.)

@item @strong{-version}, @strong{--version}
@anchor{install-tl @strong{-version}@comma{} @strong{--version}}

Output version information and exit.  If @code{-v} has also been given the
revisions of the used modules are reported, too.

@end table

@node install-tl PROFILES
@appendixsec PROFILES

A @emph{profile} file contains all the values needed to perform an
installation.  After a normal installation has finished, a profile for
that exact installation is written to the file @code{tlpkg/texlive.profile}.
In addition, from the text menu one can select @code{P} to save the current
setup as a profile at any time.  Such a profile file can be given as the
argument to @code{-profile}, for example to redo the exact same installation
on a different system.  Alternatively, you can use a custom profile,
most easily created by starting from a generated one and changing
values, or an empty file, which will take all the defaults.

Within a profile file, each line consists of

@emph{variable} [@emph{value}]

except for comment lines starting with @code{#}.  The possible variable
names are listed below.  Values, when present, are either @code{0} or @code{1}
for booleans, or strings (which must be specified without any quote
characters).  Leading whitespace is ignored.

If the variable @code{selected_scheme} is defined and @emph{no} collection
variables at all are defined, then the collections required by the
specified scheme (which might change over time) are installed, without
explicitly listing them.  This eases maintenance of profile files.  If
any collections are specified in a profile, though, then all desired
collections must be given explicitly.

For example, a line 

@verbatim
  selected_scheme scheme-small
@end verbatim

along with definitions for the installation directories (given below
under "path options") suffices to install the "small" scheme with all
default options.  The schemes are described in the @code{S} menu in the
text installer, or equivalent.

Besides @code{selected_scheme}, here is the list of variable names supported
in a profile:

@strong{collection options} (prefix @code{collection-})

Collections are specified with a variable name with the prefix
@code{collection-} followed by a collection name; there is no value.  For
instance, @code{collection-basic}.  The collections are described in the
@code{C} menu.

Schemes and collections (and packages) are ultimately defined by the
files in the @code{tlpkg/tlpsrc/} source directory.

@strong{path options}

It is best to define all of these, even though they may not be used in
the installation, so as to avoid unintentionally getting a default value
that could cause problems later.

@verbatim
  TEXDIR
  TEXMFCONFIG
  TEXMFVAR
  TEXMFHOME
  TEXMFLOCAL
  TEXMFSYSCONFIG
  TEXMFSYSVAR
@end verbatim

@strong{installer options} (prefix @code{instopt_})

@table @asis
@item @code{instopt_adjustpath} (default 0 on Unix, 1 on Windows)
@anchor{install-tl @code{instopt_adjustpath} (default 0 on Unix@comma{} 1 on Windows)}

Adjust @code{PATH} environment variable.

@item @code{instopt_adjustrepo} (default 1)
@anchor{install-tl @code{instopt_adjustrepo} (default 1)}

Set remote repository to a multiplexed CTAN mirror after installation;
see @code{-repository} above.

@item @code{instopt_letter} (default 0)
@anchor{install-tl @code{instopt_letter} (default 0)}

Set letter size paper as the default, instead of a4.

@item @code{instopt_portable} (default 0)
@anchor{install-tl @code{instopt_portable} (default 0)}

Install for portable use, e.g., on a USB stick.

@item @code{instopt_write18_restricted} (default 1)
@anchor{install-tl @code{instopt_write18_restricted} (default 1)}

Enable @code{\write18} for a restricted set of programs.

@end table

@strong{tlpdb options} (prefix @code{tlpdbopt_})

The definitive list is given in @code{tlpkg/TeXLive/TLConfig.pm}, in
@code{%TeXLive::TLConfig::TLPDBOptions}, together with explanations.  All
items given there @emph{except} for @code{tlpdbopt_location} can be specified.
Here is the current list:

@verbatim
  tlpdbopt_autobackup
  tlpdbopt_backupdir
  tlpdbopt_create_formats
  tlpdbopt_desktop_integration
  tlpdbopt_file_assocs
  tlpdbopt_generate_updmap
  tlpdbopt_install_docfiles
  tlpdbopt_install_srcfiles
  tlpdbopt_post_code
  tlpdbopt_sys_bin
  tlpdbopt_sys_info
  tlpdbopt_sys_man
  tlpdbopt_w32_multi_user
@end verbatim

@strong{platform options} (prefix @code{binary_})

For each supported platform in TeX Live (directories under @code{bin/}), the
variable @code{binary_}@emph{PLATFORM} can be set.  For example:

@verbatim
  binary_x86_64-linux
@end verbatim

If no @code{binary_} variable is specified, the default is whatever the
current machine is running.

In releases before 2017, many profile variables had different
names (not documented here; see the @code{install-tl} source).  They are
accepted and transformed to the names given above.  When a profile is
written, the names above are always used.

For more details on all of the above options, consult the TeX Live
installation manual, linked from @url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc}.

@node install-tl ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
@appendixsec ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

For ease in scripting and debugging, @code{install-tl} will look for the
following environment variables.  They are not of interest for normal
user installations.

@table @asis
@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_ENV_NOCHECK}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_ENV_NOCHECK}}

Omit the check for environment variables containing the string @code{tex}.
People developing TeX-related software are likely to have many such
variables.

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_CONTEXT_CACHE}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_CONTEXT_CACHE}}

Omit creating the ConTeXt cache.  This is useful for redistributors.

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_WELCOME}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_WELCOME}}

Omit printing the welcome message after successful installation, e.g.,
for testing.

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX}}

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR}}

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFCONFIG}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFCONFIG}}

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFVAR}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFVAR}}

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME}}

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFLOCAL}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFLOCAL}}

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSCONFIG}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSCONFIG}}

@item @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSVAR}
@anchor{install-tl @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSVAR}}

Specify the respective directories.  @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX} defaults
to @code{/usr/local/texlive}, while @code{TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR} defaults to
the release directory within that prefix, e.g.,
@code{/usr/local/texlive/2016}.  All the defaults can be seen by running the
installer interactively and then typing @code{D} for the directory menu.

@item @code{NOPERLDOC}
@anchor{install-tl @code{NOPERLDOC}}

Don't try to run the @code{--help} message through @code{perldoc}.
