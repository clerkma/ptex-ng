1 Introduction
**************

This manual (dated February 2019) corresponds to the TeX Live 2019
release.

   This manual is aimed at system installers and programmers, and
focuses on how to configure, build, and develop the TeX Live (TL)
sources.  It is also available as plain text files in the source tree:
'source/README.*'.

   The main 'source/README' file in the TL source tree provides
maximally-terse information for doing a build, and portability
information for different systems, along with
'source/doc/README.solaris'.

   For information on acquiring the TL sources, see
<https://tug.org/texlive/svn>.  The canonical source repository uses
Subversion, and we have no plans to change this.

   This manual does not duplicate the information found in other TL
documentation resources, such as:

   * The TeX Live web pages: <https://tug.org/texlive>.

   * The web page describing how to build the binaries which are
     distributed with TeX Live: <https://tug.org/texlive/build.html>.

   * The TeX Live user manual: <https://tug.org/texlive/doc.html>, or
     run 'texdoc texlive'.

   * Other TeX-related Texinfo manuals (*note (web2c)::, *note
     (kpathsea)::, etc.): <https://tug.org/texinfohtml/>, or check the
     'TeX' category in the GNU Info system.

   * Package documentation:
     <https://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/doc.html>, or the 'doc.html'
     file at the top level of the installed TL.

   As an exception, the full documentation for 'install-tl' and 'tlmgr'
is included here as appendices, simply because it is easy to do so.  The
same text is available online (linked from
<https://tug.org/texlive/doc.html>, or by invoking the program with
'--help' (or look at the end of the source).

2 Overview of build system
**************************

The TeX Live build system was redesigned in 2009 to consistently use
Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool.  Thus, running
   'configure && make && make check && make install'
or the essentially-equivalent top-level 'Build' script suffices to build
and install the TL programs.  The 'make check' clause performs various
tests of the generated programs--not strictly required but strongly
recommended.  Running 'configure --help' will display a comprehensive
list of all 'configure' options.

   The main components of the TL build system are:

'libs/LIB'
     Generic libraries.

'texk/LIB'
     TeX-specific libraries in subdirectories, notably LIB='kpathsea'.
     (The other one is 'texk/ptexenc'.)

'texk/PROG'
     TeX-specific programs (that use Kpathsea).

'utils/PROG'
     Other programs (that don't use Kpathsea).

   The primary design goal of the build system is modularity.  Each
program and library module (or package) specifies its own requirements
and properties, such as required libraries, whether an installed
(system) version of a library can be used, 'configure' options to be
seen at the top level, and more.  An explicit list of all available
modules is kept in a single central place: 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4'.

   A second, related goal is to configure and build each library before
configuring any other (program or library) module which uses that
library.  This allows checking for properties and features of a library
built as part of the TL tree in much the same way as for a system
version of that library.

   All generic libraries and several programs are maintained
independently.  The corresponding modules use (most of) the distributed
source tree and document any modifications of that source.

   All this is for the sake of simplifying both upgrading of modules and
integrating new modules into the TL build system.  (Despite all efforts,
neither task is easy.)

3 Prerequisites
***************

Overall, building the TeX Live programs, when using all libraries from
the TL source tree, requires C and C++11 compilers and GNU 'make'.  If
'make' from your 'PATH' is not GNU make, you can set the 'MAKE'
environment variable to whatever is necessary.

   GNU 'make' is required only because of some third-party libraries,
notably FreeType; all the TL-maintained directories (and
Automake/Autoconf output in general) work with any reasonable 'make'.

   A C++11 compiler is similarly required because of the third-party
libraries ICU and Poppler; the program 'dvisvgm' also requires C++11.
It is possible to build everything else with older compilers;
<https://tug.org/texlive/custom-bin.html> links to a build script for
doing this.

   However, a few programs in the tree have additional requirements:

'web2c'
     requires 'perl' for some tests run by 'make check'.

'xdvik'
'xpdfopen'
     require X11 headers and libraries, often in "development" packages
     that are not installed by default.

'xetex'
     requires 'fontconfig' (again both headers and library), or, for
     MacOSX only, the 'ApplicationServices' and 'Cocoa' frameworks.

'xindy'
     requires GNU 'clisp', 'libsigsegv', and 'libiconv'; additionally,
     to build the rules and/or documentation: 'perl', 'latex', and
     'pdflatex'

Lacking the required tools, building these programs must avoided, e.g.,
'configure --without-x --disable-xetex --disable-xindy'

   Modifying source files induces more requirements, as one might
expect:

   * Modification of any '.y' or '.l' source files requires 'bison' or
     'flex' to update the corresponding C sources.

   * Modification of the sources for '.info' files requires 'makeinfo'.

   * Modification of any part of the build system (M4 macros,
     'configure.ac', 'Makefile.am', or their fragments) requires GNU M4,
     GNU Autoconf, GNU Automake, and GNU Libtool to update the generated
     files.  Furthermore, to reliably reproduce the build files, the
     original GNU releases of these tools must be used, not any distro
     packaging of them.  *Note Build system tools::, for more
     discussion.

   If you haven't modified any source files, and infrastructure tools
such as 'autoconf' or 'makeinfo' are still being run, check your
timestamps--notably, 'use-commit-times' must be set to 'yes' in your
Subversion configuration (*note Build system tools::).  Barring buggy
commits, no infrastructure tools are needed to do a normal build.

4 Building
**********

The top-level 'Build' script is intended to simplify building the
binaries distributed with TeX Live itself--we call this the "native" TL
build.  It runs 'configure && make world', which builds everything in a
subdirectory of the main source tree (default 'Work/'), installs
everything in another subdirectory (default 'inst/'), and finally runs
'make check'.  The exact directory and command names can be specified
via environment variables and a few leading options.  All remaining
arguments (assignments or options) are passed to the 'configure' script.
Please take a look at the './Build' source file for more information; it
is a straightforward shell script.

   An alternative, and the one we will mainly discuss here, is to run
'configure' and 'make' in a suitable empty subdirectory.  Building in
the source directory itself is not supported (sorry).

File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build iteration,  Next: Build problems,  Up: Building

4.1 Build iteration
===================

Running the top-level 'configure' script configures the top level and
the subdirectories 'libs', 'utils', and 'texk'.  Running 'make' at the
top level first iterates over the TeX-specific libraries, and then runs
'make' in 'libs', 'utils', and 'texk' to iterate over the generic
libraries, utility programs, and TeX-specific programs, respectively.
These iterations consist of two steps:

  1. For each library or program module not yet configured, run
     'configure', adding the configure option '--disable-build' if the
     module need not be built, otherwise running 'make all'.

  2. For each library or program module that must be built, run 'make'
     for the selected target(s): 'default' or 'all' to (re-)build,
     'check' to run tests, 'install', etc.

   Running the top-level 'make' a second time iterates again over all
the library and program modules, and finds (should find) nothing to be
done.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build problems,  Next: Build in parallel,  Prev: Build iteration,  Up: Building

4.2 Build problems
==================

If configuring or building a module fails, you should first try to find
and fix the problem.  Failing that, a possible workaround is to remove
the subdirectory for that module from the build tree (so 'configure'
won't try to run there, and finally rerun the top level 'make' (or
'./Build' '--no-clean').


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build in parallel,  Next: Build distribution,  Prev: Build problems,  Up: Building

4.3 Build in parallel
=====================

The TL build system carefully formulates dependencies as well as 'make'
rules when a tool (such as 'tangle', 'ctangle', and 'convert') creates
several output files.  This allows for parallel builds ('make -j N' with
N>1 or even 'make -j') that can considerably speed up the TL build.

   Incidentally, a noticeable speed-up can be independently gained by
using a configure cache file, i.e., specifying the 'configure' option
'-C' (recommended).


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build distribution,  Next: Build one package,  Prev: Build in parallel,  Up: Building

4.4 Build distribution
======================

Running 'make dist' at the top level creates a tarball
'tex-live-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.xz' from the TL source tree.  Running 'make
distcheck' also verifies that this tarball suffices to build and install
all of TL.

   This is useful for checking consistency of the source tree and
Makefiles, but the result is not a complete or even usable TeX system,
since all the support files are lacking; *note Installing::.  We do not
actually distribute any such tarball, and have no plans to do so.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build one package,  Next: Build one engine,  Prev: Build distribution,  Up: Building

4.5 Build one package
=====================

To build one package, the basic idea is to use the 'configure' option
'--disable-all-pkgs' (*note --disable-all-pkgs::).  Then all program and
library modules are configured but none are made.  However, the
'Makefile's still contain all build rules and dependencies and can be
invoked to build an individual program or library, first building any
required libraries.

   This "build-on-demand" procedure is used, e.g., in the upstream
LuaTeX repository to build LuaTeX, from a subset of the complete
TeX Live source tree.  As another example, when building the original
e-TeX has been disabled (as it is by default), one can run 'make etex'
(or 'make etex.exe') in 'texk/web2c/' to build e-TeX (although there is
no comparably simple way to _install_ e-TeX).

   If you want to work on a single program within the TL sources, this
is the recommended way to do it.  Here is an example from start to
finish for working on 'dvipdfm-x'.

     mkdir mydir && cd mydir  # new working directory

     # Get sources (<https://tug.org/texlive/svn>), e.g.:
     rsync -a --delete --exclude=.svn --exclude=Work \
           tug.org::tldevsrc/Build/source/ .

     # Create build directory:
     mkdir Work && cd Work

     # Do the configure:
     ../configure --disable-all-pkgs --enable-dvipdfm-x \
       -C CFLAGS=-g CXXFLAGS=-g >&outc || echo fail

     # Do the make:
     make >&outm || echo fail

     # Test:
     cd texk/dvipdfm-x
     make check

   Then you can modify source files in 'mydir/texk/dvipdfm-x' and rerun
'make' in 'mydir/Work/texk/dvipdfm-x' to rebuild; that build directory
is where the binary ends up and where you can run a debugger, etc.

   The second line of the 'configure' invocation shows examples of extra
things you likely want to specify if you intend to hack the sources (and
not just build binaries): the '-C' speeds 'configure' by enabling a
cache file, and the 'CFLAGS' and 'CXXFLAGS' settings eliminate compiler
optimization for debugging purposes.

   Of course, you need to actually look at the output and check that
things are working.  There are many 'configure' options you can tweak as
desired; check the output from 'configure --help'.  It is also a good
idea to run 'make check' after making any changes, to ensure that
whatever tests have been written still pass.

   Finally, the above retrieves the entire TL source tree (several
hundred megabytes).  It is natural to ask if this is really necessary.
Strictly speaking, the answer is no, but it is vastly more convenient to
do so.  If you cut down the source tree, you must also give additional
'configure' flags to individually disable using system versions of
libraries, or the intricacies of the dependencies (such as 'teckit'
requiring 'zlib') will have undesired side effects.  For an example of
this approach, see the 'build-pdftex.sh' script in the 'pdftex'
development source (details at <http://pdftex.org>), which is indeed
such a cut-down TL source tree.

   Even with '--disable-all-pkgs', dependencies will be checked.  For
instance, if a (non-MacOSX) system does not have 'fontconfig', XeTeX
cannot be built (*note Prerequisites::) and 'configure' will terminate.
To proceed without such dependencies, specify '--enable-missing' also.

   By default, the 'gcc' compilers will be used if present; otherwise,
individual packages may use something different.  You can explicitly
specify the compilers to be used with the environment variables 'CC',
'CXX', and 'OBJCXX'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build one engine,  Next: Cross compilation,  Prev: Build one package,  Up: Building

4.6 Build one engine
====================

Unfortunately, there is one common case where the steps in the preceding
section to build one package (*note Build one package::) do not suffice:
wanting to build one, or a subset, of the TeX engines (or other Web2c
programs).

   The simplest way to do this is to disable everything and then
explicitly specify what to make.  For example, to build only LuaTeX:

     ./configure --disable-all-pkgs  # or ./Build
     cd Work/texk/web2c              # build directory
     make luatex                     # specify target

   This works because the 'make' automatically runs 'configure' as
necessary for the dependencies and target.  Furthermore, the source tree
can be cut down to just what is needed for the given engine (as the
separate pdfTeX and LuaTeX source repositories do).

   We hope to improve the situation in the future.  Patches are welcome.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Cross compilation,  Prev: Build one engine,  Up: Building

4.7 Cross compilation
=====================

In a cross compilation a "build" system is used to create binaries to be
executed on a "host" system with different hardware and/or operating
system.

   In simple cases, the build system can execute binaries for the host
system.  This typically occurs for bi-arch systems where, e.g.,
'i386-linux' binaries can run on 'x86_64-linux' systems and 'win32'
binaries can run on 'win64' systems.  Although sometimes called "native
cross", technically this is not cross compilation at all.  In most such
cases it suffices to specify suitable compiler flags.  It might be
useful to add the configure option '--build=HOST' to get the correct
canonical host name, but note that this should _not_ be '--host=HOST'
(*note (autoconf)Hosts and Cross-Compilation::).

   In order to build, e.g., 32-bit binaries with 'clang' on a 64-bit
MacOSX system one could use:

     TL_BUILD_ENV="CC='clang -arch i386' \
       CXX='clang++ -arch i386' \
       OBJCXX='clang++ -arch i386'" \
       ./Build --build=i386-apple-darwin

* Menu:

* Cross configuring::           Configuring for cross compilation.
* Cross problems::              Cross compilation problems.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Cross configuring,  Next: Cross problems,  Up: Cross compilation

4.7.1 Cross configuring
-----------------------

In a standard cross compilation, binaries for the host system cannot
execute on the build system and it is necessary to specify the configure
options '--host=HOST' and '--build=BUILD' with two different values.

   Building binaries requires suitable "cross" tools, e.g., compiler,
linker, and archiver, and perhaps a "cross" version of 'pkg-config' and
similar to locate host system libraries.  Autoconf expects that these
cross tools are given by their usual variables or found under their
usual name prefixed with 'HOST-'.  Here a list of such tools and
corresponding variables:

     ar                AR
     freetype-config   FT2_CONFIG
     g++               CXX
     gcc               CC
     icu-config        ICU_CONFIG
     objdump           OBJDUMP
     pkg-config        PKG_CONFIG
     ranlib            RANLIB
     strip             STRIP

In order to, e.g., build 'mingw32' binaries on 'x86_64-linux' with a
cross compiler found as 'i386-pc-mingw32-gcc' one would specify

     --host=i386-pc-mingw32 --build=x86_64-linux-gnu

or perhaps

     --host=mingw32 --build=x86_64-linux CC=i386-pc-mingw32-gcc

but this latter, especially, might require adding 'CXX' and others.

   Configure arguments such as 'CFLAGS=...' refer to the cross compiler.
If necessary, you can specify compilers and flags for the few auxiliary
C and C++ programs required for the build process as configure arguments

     BUILDCC=...
     BUILDCPPFLAGS=...
     BUILDCFLAGS=...
     BUILDCXX=...
     BUILDCXXFLAGS=...
     BUILDLDFLAGS=...


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Cross problems,  Prev: Cross configuring,  Up: Cross compilation

4.7.2 Cross problems
--------------------

The fact that binaries for the host system cannot be executed on the
build system causes some problems.

   One problem is that configure tests using 'AC_RUN_IFELSE' can compile
and link the test program but cannot execute it.  Such tests should be
avoided if possible and otherwise must supply a pessimistic test result.

   Another problem arises if the build process must execute some
(auxiliary or installable) programs.  Auxiliary programs can be placed
into a subdirectory that is configured natively as is done for
'texk/web2c/web2c', 'texk/dvipsk/squeeze', and 'texk/xdvik/squeeze'.
The module 'libs/freetype2' uses the value of 'CC_BUILD', 'BUILD-gcc',
'gcc', or 'cc' as the compiler for the auxiliary program.

   The situation for installable programs needed by the build process is
somewhat different.  A rather expensive possibility, chosen for the ICU
libraries in module 'libs/icu', is to first compile natively for the
build system and in a second step to use these (uninstalled) programs
during the cross compilation.

   This approach would also be possible for the tools such as 'tangle'
used in the module 'texk/web2c' to build the WEB programs, but that
would require first building a native 'kpathsea' library.  To avoid this
complication, cross compilation of programs written in (C)WEB requires
sufficiently recent installed versions of 'tangle', 'ctangle',
'otangle', and 'tie'.

   Building 'xindy' requires running the host system 'clisp' binary,
thus cross compilation is painful, but possible.

5 Installing
************

This section discusses the results of 'make install' in the source tree.

   The main consideration is that 'make install' is not enough to make a
usable TeX installation.  Beyond the compiled binaries, (thousands of)
support files are needed; just as a first example, 'plain.tex' is not in
the source tree.

   These support files are maintained completely independently and are
not present in the TL source tree.  The best basis for dealing with them
is the TeX Live (plain text) database in 'Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb',
and/or the TeX Live installer, 'install-tl'.  More information is under
'Master/tlpkg' and at <https://tug.org/texlive/distro.html>.

* Menu:

* Installation directories::    The prefix, 'bindir', etc., directories.
* Linked scripts::              Scripts not maintained in the sources.
* Distro builds::               Configuring and building for OS distributions.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Installation directories,  Next: Linked scripts,  Up: Installing

5.1 Installation directories
============================

Running 'make install' (or 'make install-strip') installs executables in
'BINDIR', libraries in 'LIBDIR', headers in 'INCLUDEDIR', general data
(including "linked scripts", *note Linked scripts::) in
'DATAROOTDIR/texmf-dist', man pages in 'MANDIR', and Info files in
'INFODIR'.

   The values of these directories are determined by 'configure' and can
be specified explicitly as options such as '--prefix=PREFIX' or
'--bindir=BINDIR'; otherwise, they are given by their usual Autoconf
defaults:

     PREFIX                  /usr/local
     EXEC_PREFIX             PREFIX
     BINDIR                  EXEC_PREFIX/bin
     LIBDIR                  EXEC_PREFIX/lib
     INCLUDEDIR              PREFIX/include
     DATAROOTDIR             PREFIX/share
     MANDIR                  DATAROOTDIR/man
     INFODIR                 DATAROOTDIR/info

except possibly modified as follows:

   * If the option '--enable-multiplatform' is given, '/PLATFORM' (i.e.,
     the canonical platform name) is appended to 'BINDIR' and 'LIBDIR'.
     This is implied for a native TL build.

   * In a native TL build, 'DATAROOTDIR' is set to 'PREFIX', 'INFODIR'
     is set to 'PREFIX/texmf-dist/doc/info', and 'MANDIR' to
     'PREFIX/texmf-dist/doc/man', corresponding to the directories used
     in the TL distribution.

The top-level 'configure' script displays all these installation paths.

   For the native TL build, the 'Build' script leaves the binaries in
'./inst/bin/STD-SYSTEM-TRIPLET'.  The new binaries are not directly
usable from that location; they need to be copied to
'Master/bin/TL-PLATFORM'.  The other files and directories that end up
in './inst/' are ignored.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Linked scripts,  Next: Distro builds,  Prev: Installation directories,  Up: Installing

5.2 Linked scripts
==================

Quite a few executables are architecture-independent shell, Perl, or
other interpreted scripts, rather than compiled binaries.  A few are
maintained as part of the TL source tree, but most are maintained
elsewhere with copies under 'texk/texlive/linked_scripts'.

   These so-called "linked scripts" are installed under
'DATAROOTDIR/texmf-dist/scripts'; for Unix-like systems a symbolic link
is made in 'BINDIR'.  For example, a symlink points from 'BINDIR/ps2eps'
to 'DATAROOTDIR/texmf-dist/scripts/ps2eps/ps2eps.pl'.  For Windows, a
standard wrapper binary (copied to, e.g., 'BINDIR/ps2eps.exe') serves
the same purpose.  The source for the wrapper is in
'texk/texlive/w32_wrapper'.

   One reason for this is to avoid having many copies of the same
script; a more important reason is that it guarantees the scripts will
stay in sync across the different supported operating systems.

   Most important of all, we want the 'BINDIR' resulting from the build
to be as close as possible to what is in the TL distribution.  At
present, there are a few exceptions--Asymptote, Biber, Xindy--and each
one creates considerable extra work.  We don't want to add more.  (See
<https://tug.org/texlive/build.html> for information about building
those exceptions, as well as the 'xz' and 'wget' programs that are used
in the TL infrastructure.)


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Distro builds,  Prev: Linked scripts,  Up: Installing

5.3 Distro builds
=================

Although they use the same code base, building for the native TL
distribution as shipped by the TeX user groups is typically quite
different from a "distro" build needed by, e.g., a full GNU/Linux or BSD
operating system distribution.

   The native TL distribution uses shared libraries only when absolutely
necessary ('libc', 'libm', X11 libraries, and 'libfontconfig').  In
contrast, a distro typically wants to use as many shared libraries as
possible from elsewhere on the system, including TeX-specific libraries
such as 'libkpathsea' (even though Kpathsea has never officially been
released as a shared library).  In addition, the installation paths
will, in general, be completely different.

   Here are the 'configure' options that distro builds are likely to
find most relevant:

'--disable-native-texlive-build'
     This must be specified to avoid interference from the many tweaks
     we do for the native TL build.

'--with-banner-add=/SOMEDISTRO'
     This isn't technically required, but is strongly recommended, so
     your build and your distro can be distinguished from others.

'--enable-shared'
     Build shared versions of the TeX-specific libraries (uses
     'libtool').

'--disable-static'
     Do not build the static versions of the TeX-specific libraries.

'--with-system-LIB'
     Look for and use a system version of the library LIB.  'configure
     --help' will give you the list of possibilities.

'--with-LIB-includes=DIR'
'--with-LIB-libdir=DIR'
     If needed, allows you to specify where the headers/code are for the
     given library LIB.

'--prefix=/usr'
'--prefix=/opt/TeXLive'
     Or whatever your convention is.  The default is '/usr/local' and
     you shouldn't install there for a distro.

'--libdir=\${exec_prefix}/lib64'
     May be needed for 64-bit bi-architecture (GNU/Linux) systems.

   You will need to take care of the support files mentioned above
(*note Installing::), and many other issues, such as font maps,
languages, and formats, independently of the build.  Norbert Preining
has written a detailed article on adapting TL for distros:
<https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb34-3/tb108preining-distro.pdf>.  (If the
article needs updating in the future, perhaps we will merge it into this
document.)

File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Build system tools,  Next: Top-level directories,  Up: Layout and infrastructure

6.1 Build system tools
======================

As mentioned above (*note Prerequisites::), a normal build has few
requirements.  On the other hand, if you want to modify the TeX Live
infrastructure sources, such as 'configure.ac' or 'Makefile.am' files,
you will need to have several additional tools installed.

   In general, the TL build system uses the latest released versions of
the GNU build tools, installed directly from the original GNU releases
(e.g., by building them with 'configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu' and
having 'PATH' start with '/usr/local/gnu/bin').  We have found that
trying to use the versions of these tools packaged for distros causes
many extra hassles, so don't do that, tempting as it may be.

   Currently the versions we use are:

     autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.69
     automake (GNU automake) 1.16.1
     bison (GNU Bison) 3.3.1
     flex 2.6.0
     ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 2.4.6
     m4 (GNU M4) 1.4.18
     makeinfo (GNU texinfo) 6.6

   These versions should be used to update the generated files (e.g.,
'configure' or 'Makefile.in') in all or parts of the TL tree after their
dependencies have been changed.  This can be done explicitly with the
top-level 'reautoconf' script or implicitly by using the configure
option '--enable-maintainer-mode'.

   It has often turned out that the bison and flex versions are not
critical; however, the autotools versions are.  If you don't have the
given versions, get them before modifying the build infrastructure.

   The files in the Subversion repository (see
<https://tug.org/texlive/svn>) are all up to date (barring bugs).  For
this to be reflected by their timestamps in your checkout, be sure to
set 'use-commit-times=yes' in '~/.subversion/config' or the equivalent.

   If timestamps are wrong, you may also be able to avoid unnecessary
runs of 'bison', 'flex', or 'makeinfo' with 'touch' of the generated
('.c', '.h', or '.info') files.  With '--enable-maintainer-mode' it may
also be necessary to 'touch' first 'aclocal.m4', then 'configure' and
'config.h.in' (or 'c-auto.in'), and finally all 'Makefile.in' files.
Perhaps 'make -t' will help.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Top-level directories,  Next: Autoconf macros,  Prev: Build system tools,  Up: Layout and infrastructure

6.2 Top-level directories
=========================

Here is a brief description of the top-level directories in the TeX Live
source tree.

   As mentioned at the beginning of *note Overview of build system::,
the main source directories are 'texk/' (TeX-specific programs and
libraries), 'utils/' (additional programs), and 'libs/' (generic
libraries).

   In addition, the top-level directories 'am/' and 'm4/' contain
'Makefile.am' fragments and Autoconf macros, respectively, used in many
places.  Specifically, the file 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4' contains lists of all
program and library modules; missing modules are silently ignored.
(This helps in creating cut-down source trees.)

   Each module contributes fragments (in separate files) defining its
capabilities and requirements to the 'configure.ac' scripts at the
top-level and in the subdirectories 'libs', 'utils', and 'texk'.  The
fragments from program modules supply 'configure' options to disable or
enable building them; those from library modules specify if an installed
(system) version of that library can be used.  This ultimately
determines which modules need to be built--although all modules must be
configured for the benefit of 'make' targets such as 'dist' or
'distcheck'.

   The top-level 'build-aux/' directory contains the common files
'compile', 'config.guess', 'config.sub', 'depcomp', etc. used by most
packages.  These are taken from the GNU Gnulib sources
(<https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib>), which in turn synchronizes with
any ultimate upstream repository.  There are independent copies of some
of these in a few other places, e.g.,
'libs/freetype2/freetype-*/builds/unix/'.  The 'reautoconf' script does
not touch those, but a TL cron job keeps them in sync (nightly).

   When the top-level './Build' script is used to build TL, two more two
more top-level directories appear: 'Work/' for the build tree, and
'inst/' for the install tree (from 'make install').  These names (and
everything else about 'Build''s operation) can be changed by setting
environment variables before running it; see the script source.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Autoconf macros,  Next: Library modules,  Prev: Top-level directories,  Up: Layout and infrastructure

6.3 Autoconf macros
===================

Here we describe a few of the Autoconf macros used in several
modules--many more are defined in the sources; see the top-level 'm4/'
directory.  These general macros are supplemented by module-specific
macros in directories such as 'texk/dvipng/m4/'; some of those are
described in following sections (*note Library modules:: and *note
Program modules::).

* Menu:

* Setup:     General setup macros.
* Programs:  Macros for programs.
* Compilers: Macros for compilers.
* Libraries: Macros for libraries.
* Flags:     Macros for library and header flags.
* Windows:   Macros for Windows.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: General setup macros,  Next: Macros for programs,  Up: Autoconf macros

6.3.1 General setup macros
--------------------------

The TL sources use two general setup macros:

 -- Macro: KPSE_BASIC (NAME, [MORE-OPTIONS])
     Initialize the basic TL infrastructure for module NAME:
        'AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign MORE-OPTIONS])'
        'AM_MAINTAINER_MODE'
        'KPSE_COMPILER_WARNINGS'
     and make sure the C compiler understands function prototypes.  This
     is used for all generic library and program modules.

 -- Macro: KPSE_COMMON (NAME, [MORE-OPTIONS])
     Like 'KPSE_BASIC' but add:
        'LT_PREREQ([2.2.6])'
        'LT_INIT([win32-dll])'
        'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE'
        'AC_FUNC_FSEEKO'
     along with checks for frequently used functions, headers, types,
     and structures.  This is used for TeX-specific modules.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Macros for programs,  Next: Macros for compilers,  Prev: General setup macros,  Up: Autoconf macros

6.3.2 Macros for programs
-------------------------

Macros for program checks:

 -- Macro: KPSE_CHECK_LATEX
     Set 'LATEX' to the first of 'latex', 'elatex', or 'lambda' which
     exists in 'PATH', or to 'no' if none of them exists.  Call
     'AC_SUBST' for 'LATEX'.  The result of this test can be overridden
     by setting the 'LATEX' environment variable or the cache variable
     'ac_cv_prog_LATEX'.

 -- Macro: KPSE_CHECK_PDFLATEX
     Check for 'pdflatex' in 'PATH' and set 'PDFLATEX'.

 -- Macro: KPSE_CHECK_PERL
     Check for 'perl' or 'perl5' in 'PATH' and set 'PERL'.

 -- Macro: KPSE_PROG_LEX
     Call 'AC_PROG_LEX' and add the flag '-l' for 'flex'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Macros for compilers,  Next: Macros for libraries,  Prev: Macros for programs,  Up: Autoconf macros

6.3.3 Macros for compilers
--------------------------

Macros for compiler-related checks:

 -- Macro: KPSE_COMPILER_WARNINGS
     When using the (Objective) C/C++ compiler, set
     'WARNING_[OBJ]C[XX]FLAGS' to suitable warning flags (depending on
     the value given to or implied for '--enable-compiler-warnings').
     Call 'AC_SUBST' for them.  At present this assumes GNU compiler
     warning options, but could be extended to others if necessary.

     This macro caches its results in the 'kpse_cv_warning_cflags', ...
     variables.

 -- Macro: KPSE_COMPILER_VISIBILITY
     When using the C or C++ compiler, try to set
     'VISIBILITY_C[XX]FLAGS' to flags to hide external symbols.  Call
     'AC_SUBST' for this variable.  At present this only tests for the
     compiler option '-fvisibility=hidden', but could be extended if
     necessary.

     This macro caches its results in the 'kpse_cv_visibility_cflags' or
     'kpse_cv_visibility_cxxflags' variable.

 -- Macro: KPSE_CXX_HACK
     Provide the configure option '--enable-cxx-runtime-hack'.  If
     enabled and when using 'g++', try to statically link with
     'libstdc++', notably improving portability of the resulting binary.

     This macro caches its result in the 'kpse_cv_cxx_hack' variable.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Macros for libraries,  Next: Macros for library and header flags,  Prev: Macros for compilers,  Up: Autoconf macros

6.3.4 Macros for libraries
--------------------------

One macro for a library check:

 -- Macro: KPSE_LARGEFILE (VARIABLE, [EXTRA-DEFINE])
     Call 'AC_SYS_LARGEFILE' and 'AC_FUNC_FSEEKO' and append suitable
     '-D' flags (optionally including '-DEXTRA-DEFINE') to VARIABLE.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Macros for library and header flags,  Next: Macros for Windows,  Prev: Macros for libraries,  Up: Autoconf macros

6.3.5 Macros for library and header flags
-----------------------------------------

Each library module 'libs/LIB' or 'texk/LIB' is supplemented by a macro
'KPSE_LIB_FLAGS' (all uppercase) that provides make variables for that
library.  E.g., for 'libs/libpng':

 -- Macro: KPSE_LIBPNG_FLAGS
     Provide the configure option '--with-system-libpng'.  Set and
     'AC_SUBST' 'make' variables for modules using this library (either
     an installed version or from the TeX Live tree):

     'LIBPNG_INCLUDES'   for use in 'CPPFLAGS',
     'LIBPNG_LIBS'       for use in 'LDADD',
     'LIBPNG_DEPEND'     for use as a Makefile dependency,
     'LIBPNG_RULE'       for the 'make' rules to rebuild the library.

 -- Macro: KPSE_ADD_FLAGS (NAME)
     Temporarily extend 'CPPFLAGS' and 'LIBS' with the values required
     for the library module 'NAME'.

 -- Macro: KPSE_RESTORE_FLAGS
     Restore 'CPPFLAGS' and 'LIBS' to their original values.

   As an example, the 'configure.ac' file for a hypothetical program
'utils/foo' using 'libpng', and hence 'zlib', would contain
     KPSE_ZLIB_FLAGS
     KPSE_LIBPNG_FLAGS

and its 'Makefile.am' would be along these lines:
     bin_PROGRAMS = foo
     AM_CPPFLAGS = ${LIBPNG_INCLUDES} ${ZLIB_INCLUDES}
     foo_LDADD = ${LIBPNG_LIBS} ${ZLIB_LIBS}
     foo_DEPENDENCIES = ${ZLIB_DEPEND} ${LIBPNG_DEPEND}
     ## Rebuild libz
     @ZLIB_RULE@
     ## Rebuild libpng
     @LIBPNG_RULE@

   If it were necessary to examine whether certain 'zlib' or 'libpng'
features were available, 'configure.ac' should be continued this way:
     KPSE_ADD_FLAGS([zlib])
     ... # tests for 'zlib' features, if any
     KPSE_ADD_FLAGS([libpng])
     ... # tests for 'libpng' features
     KPSE_RESTORE_FLAGS # restore 'CPPFLAGS' and 'LIBS'


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Macros for Windows,  Prev: Macros for library and header flags,  Up: Autoconf macros

6.3.6 Macros for Windows
------------------------

Windows differs in several aspects from Unix-like systems, many of them
due to the lack of symbolic links.

 -- Macro: KPSE_CHECK_WIN32
     Check if compiling for a Windows system.  The result is either 'no'
     for Unix-like systems (including Cygwin), 'mingw32' for Windows
     with GCC, or 'native' for Windows with MSVC. The result is cached
     in the 'kpse_cv_have_win32' variable.

 -- Macro: KPSE_COND_WIN32
     Call 'KPSE_CHECK_WIN32' and define the Automake conditional 'WIN32'
     ('true' if the value of 'kpse_cv_have_win32' is not 'no').

 -- Macro: KPSE_COND_MINGW32
     Call 'KPSE_COND_WIN32' and define the Automake conditional
     'MINGW32' ('true' if the value of 'kpse_cv_have_win32' is
     'mingw32').

 -- Macro: KPSE_COND_WIN32_WRAP
     Call 'KPSE_COND_WIN32' and define the Automake conditional
     'WIN32_WRAP' ('true' if the standard Windows wrapper
     ('texk/texlive/w32_wrapper/runscript.exe') exists.  This wrapper is
     used on Windows instead of symlinks for the "linked scripts" (*note
     Linked scripts::).

 -- Macro: KPSE_WIN32_CALL
     Call 'KPSE_COND_WIN32' and check if the file
     'texk/texlive/w32_wrapper/callexe.c' exists; if it does, create a
     symlink in the build tree.  Compiling 'callexe.c' with
     '-DEXEPROG='"FOO.exe"'' and installing 'callexe.exe' as 'BAR.exe'
     is used on Windows instead of a symlink 'BAR->FOO' for Unix-like
     systems.

6.4 Library modules
===================

Here we discuss some specifics for a few of the libraries in TL, both
for the details themselves, and as a way of illuminating the general
structure and variation.

* Menu:

* png library::       'libs/libpng'
* zlib library::      'libs/zlib'
* freetype library::  'libs/freetype2'
* kpathsea library::  'texk/kpathsea'


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: png library,  Next: zlib library,  Up: Library modules

6.4.1 The 'png' library in 'libs/libpng'
----------------------------------------

The "generic" 'png' library uses the source tree in the subdirectory
'libpng-src/', with all modifications for TL recorded in 'TLpatches/*'.
The 'configure.ac' fragment 'ac/withenable.ac' contains

     KPSE_WITH_LIB([libpng], [zlib])

to specify the module name and indicate the dependency on 'zlib'.  A
third literal argument ''tree'' would specify that the library from the
TeX Live tree cannot be replaced by a system version.  That not being
the case here, a second fragment 'ac/libpng.ac' contains

     KPSE_TRY_LIB([libpng],
                  [#include <png.h>],
                  [png_structp png; png_voidp io; png_rw_ptr fn;
     png_set_read_fn(png, io, fn);])

thus providing the simple C code

     #include <png.h>
     int main ()
     { png_structp png; png_voidp io; png_rw_ptr fn;
       png_set_read_fn(png, io, fn);
       return 0; }

which Autoconf uses to verify the usability of a system version with C
code.  The analogous macro 'KPSE_TRY_LIBXX' would check using C++.
These fragments are included by the 'configure.ac' at the top level of
TL ('Build/source/configure.ac').

   For this library, like many other modules, a proxy build system for
TL is used, consisting of our own 'configure.ac', 'Makefile.am',
'include/Makefile.am'; the distributed build system is not used.
(Consequently, a few generated files and auxiliary scripts are removed
from the distributed source tree.)

   The public headers 'png.h', 'pngconf.h', and 'pnglibconf.h' are
"installed" (as symlinks) under 'include/' in the build tree exactly as
they are for a system version under, e.g., '/usr/include/'.

   The module is supplemented by the file 'm4/kpse-libpng-flags.m4' that
defines the M4 macro 'KPSE_LIBPNG_FLAGS' used by all modules depending
on this library in their 'configure.ac' to generate the 'make' variables
'LIBPNG_INCLUDES' for use in 'CPPFLAGS', 'LIBPNG_LIBS' for use in
'LDADD', 'LIBPNG_DEPEND' for use as dependencies, and 'LIBPNG_RULE' for
the 'make' rules to rebuild the library.

   'm4/kpse-libpng-flags.m4' also supplies the configure option
'--with-system-libpng', which then uses 'pkg-config' to determine the
flags required for the system library.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: zlib library,  Next: freetype library,  Prev: png library,  Up: Library modules

6.4.2 The 'zlib' library in 'libs/zlib'
---------------------------------------

This generic library is very much analogous to 'libpng', but without the
dependency on any other library.  The file 'm4/kpse-zlib-flags.m4'
supplies the configure option '--with-system-zlib', as well as
'--with-zlib-includes' and '--with-zlib-libdir' to specify non-standard
locations of the 'zlib' headers and/or library.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: freetype library,  Next: kpathsea library,  Prev: zlib library,  Up: Library modules

6.4.3 The 'freetype' library in 'libs/freetype2'
------------------------------------------------

This module uses a wrapper build system.  In contrast to the proxy build
described earlier, the wrapper build has an almost trivial
'configure.ac' and a 'Makefile.am' which invokes the 'configure' and
'make' in the distributed source, followed by 'make install' with the TL
build tree as destination.  In other words, this actually uses the build
system provided by upstream (possibly patched).

   The flags required for the system library are obtained through
'freetype-config'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: kpathsea library,  Prev: freetype library,  Up: Library modules

6.4.4 The 'kpathsea' library in 'texk/kpathsea'
-----------------------------------------------

This is one of the TeX-specific libraries that are maintained as part of
TeX Live (*note (kpathsea)::); the other is 'ptexenc'.  These TeX
libraries are Libtool libraries (static and/or shared) and are installed
by 'make install' together with the programs.  They are, however, not
part of the TL DVD as distributed by TeX user groups, and have never
been officially released for standalone use.

   It is possible, and probably useful for distro builds (*note Distro
builds::), to specify the configure option '--with-system-kpathsea' in
order to use a system version of the library.  Programs outside the TL
tree should use 'pkg-config' for the required flags.

   In addition to 'kpathsea/ac/withenable.ac' and
'kpathsea/ac/kpathsea.ac' here there is a third fragment
'kpathsea.ac/mktex.ac', included by both 'withenable.ac' and
'configure.ac', which supplies configure options such as
'--enable-mktextfm-default'.  These determine the compile time default
of whether or not to run 'mktextfm' (and similar) to generate a missing
'.tfm' (or whatever) file.  In any case, however, the command line
options '-mktex=tfm' or '-no-mktex=tfm' for the TeX-like engines
override this default.

6.5 Program modules
===================

As with libraries (*note Library modules::), here we discuss the details
for a few of the programs in TL.

* Menu:

* t1utils package:: 'utils/t1utils'
* xindy package::   'utils/xindy'
* xdvik package::   'texk/xdvik'
* asymptote::       'utils/asymptote'


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: t1utils package,  Next: xindy package,  Up: Program modules

6.5.1 The 't1utils' package in 'utils/t1utils'
----------------------------------------------

Here we use the distributed source tree 't1utils-src' with modifications
documented in 'TLpatches/*' and a proxy build system consisting of
'configure.ac' and 'Makefile.am'.  The fragment 'ac/withenable.ac'
contains

     KPSE_ENABLE_PROG([t1utils])

specifying the module name without any dependencies, and supplies the
configure option '--disable-t1utils'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: xindy package,  Next: xdvik package,  Prev: t1utils package,  Up: Program modules

6.5.2 The 'xindy' package in 'utils/xindy'
------------------------------------------

This module uses the distributed source tree 'xindy-src/' with
modifications documented in 'TLpatches/*', and a wrapper 'configure.ac'
and 'Makefile.am' that descends into 'xindy-src'.

   The 'xindy' build requires a 'make' that supports a 'VPATH' build,
can handle all targets, and do not refer to '${top_srcdir}' or
'${top_builddir}'.  The fragment 'xindy/ac/withenable.ac' contains

     KPSE_ENABLE_PROG([xindy], , [disable])
     m4_include(kpse_TL[utils/xindy/ac/xindy.ac])
     m4_include(kpse_TL[utils/xindy/ac/clisp.ac])

where 'disable' in the third argument indicates that 'xindy' is only
built if explicitly enabled by the user with 'configure --enable-xindy'
(the need for 'clisp' makes it too painful to enable by default).

   The additional fragments 'ac/xindy.ac' and 'ac/clisp.ac' specify more
'configure' options to be seen at the top level, with 'ac/xindy.ac' also
included by 'configure.ac'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: xdvik package,  Next: asymptote,  Prev: xindy package,  Up: Program modules

6.5.3 The 'xdvik' package in 'texk/xdvik'
-----------------------------------------

This package is maintained as part of the TeX Live tree with sources in
its own directory ('texk/xdvik/').  The fragment
'xdvik/ac/withenable.ac' contains

     dnl extra_dirs = texk/xdvik/squeeze
     KPSE_ENABLE_PROG([xdvik], [kpathsea freetype2], [x])
     m4_include(kpse_TL[texk/xdvik/ac/xdvik.ac])

thus specifying dependencies on the 'kpathsea', 'freetype', and X11
libraries.  The M4 comment (following 'dnl') signals the subsidiary
'squeeze/configure.ac'.  This is needed because the main executable
'xdvi-bin' (to be installed as, e.g., 'xdvi-xaw') is for the 'host'
system whereas the auxiliary program 'squeeze/squeeze' has to run on the
'build' system; in a cross compilation, these differ.

   The additional fragment 'ac/xdvik.ac' is also included by
'configure.ac' and supplies the configure option '--with-xdvi-x-toolkit'
also seen at the top level.

6.5.4 The subdirectory 'utils/asymptote'
----------------------------------------

This subdirectory contains the sources for 'asy' and 'xasy' but due to
its complexity and prerequisites (e.g., OpenGL) it is not part of the TL
build system.  These programs must be built and installed independently,
but are included on the TL DVD together with their support files.  See
<https://tug.org/build.html#asymptote>.

6.6 Extending TeX Live
======================

This section outlines the basic process for adding new packages to the
TL build system.

   In any case, a new package directory 'foo' should contain the
original sources, modified only with changes necessary for TL, in
'foo/foo-src'.  The changes should be documented in 'foo/TLpatches/*',
and also be submitted upstream whenever reasonable.  In addition, 'foo/'
will need the usual Automake build-related files ('configure.ac',
'Makefile.am', etc.  Please maintain 'foo/ChangeLog' for all TL changes.

File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Adding a new program module,  Next: Adding a new generic library module,  Up: Extending TeX Live

6.6.1 Adding a new program module
---------------------------------

A TeX-specific program module in a subdirectory 'texk/PROG' may use the
TeX-specific libraries and is included by adding its name 'PROG' to the
M4 list 'kpse_texk_pkgs' defined in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4'.

   A generic program module in a subdirectory 'utils/PROG' must not use
the TeX-specific libraries and is included by adding its name 'PROG' to
the M4 list 'kpse_utils_pkgs' in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4'.

   In either case, the subdirectory 'texk/PROG' or 'utils/PROG' must
provide a fragment 'ac/withenable.ac' that contains the M4 macro
'KPSE_ENABLE_PROG' defined in 'm4/kpse-setup.m4' with 'PROG' as the
mandatory first argument and three optional arguments:

  1. a list of required libraries from the TL tree;

  2. a list of options: 'disable' if this module is not to be built
     without the configure option '--enable-PROG', 'native' if cross
     compilation is not possible, 'x' if the program requires X11
     libraries;

  3. a comment added to the help text for the 'configure' option
     '--enable-PROG' or '--disable-PROG'.

   If the module requires specific 'configure' options to be seen at the
top level, they should be defined in an additional fragment 'ac/PROG.ac'
included from 'ac/withenable.ac' and 'configure.ac'.

   Usually, the new program is maintained somewhere outside of TeX Live.
In that case, as above, we put the upstream sources into a subdirectory
'PROG-src' (e.g., 'utils/newprog/newprog-src').  We do not typically run
'configure' in this original '...-src' directory, but only in our own
directory; but we do compile using the source files in '...-src'.

   So, to summarize the files that we must (usually) create:

'ac/withenable.ac'
     The 'KPSE_ENABLE_PROG' call just explained.

'configure.ac'
'Makefile.am'
     By merging the contents of the original 'configure.ac' (if
     provided) and a comparable program already in TL. There is no magic
     recipe, it's necessary to think about needs to be done in the
     original vs. in TeX Live.

'TLpatches/TL-Changes'
     Actions taken after getting the original source tree; typically
     removal of derived or unused common files.

'TLpatches/patch-...'
     If any changes are needed to the original sources, record the
     patches here so they can be applied next time.  And send them
     upstream so that perhaps they won't have to be.

'ChangeLog'
     Record all TL-specific changes, now and in the future.

   Then, run GNU 'autoreconf' in the new directory (*note Build system
tools::).  After that works, 'svn add' the necessary files, including
the generated 'Makefile.in aclocal.m4 configure', and 'svn:ignore' the
Automake cache 'autom4te.cache'.  (This is so people checking out the TL
source tree do not have to run any autotools, but can simply run
'configure'.)

   Then, run the TL tool 'reautoconf' in the top-level TL 'source/'
directory, to incorporate the new program into the build tree.

   Then, run (and rerun) a build until the program compiles and tests
successfully, probably involving rerunning autoreconf in the source
directory, 'make' in the build directory, etc.

   After final success, don't forget to commit.

6.6.2 Adding a new generic library module
-----------------------------------------

A generic library module in a subdirectory 'libs/LIB' must not depend on
TeX-specific libraries, by definition.  It is included by adding its
name 'LIB' to the M4 macro 'kpse_libs_pkgs' in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4'--before
any other libraries from the TeX Live tree on which it depends.

   As with program modules, the subdirectory 'libs/LIB' must contain the
sources and build system for the library (and any installable support
programs) and a fragment 'ac/withenable.ac' that contains the M4 macro
'KPSE_WITH_LIB' defined in 'm4/kpse-setup.m4' with 'LIB' as the
mandatory first argument and two optional arguments: a list of required
libraries from the TL tree, and a list of options: for libraries,
currently there is only one--specify 'tree' if this library cannot be
replaced by a system version.

   If a system version can be used, a second fragment 'ac/LIB.ac' is
needed, containing the M4 macro 'KPSE_TRY_LIB' (or 'KPSE_TRY_LIBXX')
with 'LIB' as the mandatory first argument and two additional arguments
for the Autoconf macro 'AC_LANG_PROGRAM' used to compile and link a
small C (or C++) program as sanity check for using the system library.

   In addition a file 'm4/kpse-LIB-flags' (at the top level) must define
the M4 macro 'KPSE_LIB_FLAGS' (all uppercase) setting up the 'make'
variables 'LIB_INCLUDES', 'LIB_LIBS', 'LIB_DEPEND', and 'LIB_RULE' with
the values required for 'CPPFLAGS', 'LDADD', dependencies, and a
(multi-line) 'make' rule to rebuild the library when necessary.  All of
that is needed for the library from the TL tree and, if supported, for a
system version.

   If a system library is allowed, 'KPSE_LIB_FLAGS' also provides the
configure option '--with-system-LIB' and uses the additional M4 macro
'KPSE_LIB_SYSTEM_FLAGS' to generate the 'make' variables for a system
library.  In addition, the definition of the M4 macro
'KPSE_ALL_SYSTEM_FLAGS' in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4' must be extended by the
line:
   'AC_REQUIRE([KPSE_LIB_SYSTEM_FLAGS])'

6.6.3 Adding a new TeX-specific library module
----------------------------------------------

A TeX-specific library module in a subdirectory 'texk/LIB' may depend on
other TeX-specific libraries but must not depend on any generic library
from the TL tree.  It is included in the same general ways as a generic
library (see the previous section), with these modifications:

   * The library name 'LIB' is added to the M4 macro
     'kpse_texlibs_pkgs', which is also in 'm4/kpse-pkgs.m4'.

   * The fragment 'ac/withenable.ac' must use 'KPSE_WITH_TEXLIB'.

7 Configure options
*******************

Corresponding to the large number of program and library modules there
are a large number 'configure' options, most of which are described
here.  The command
   'configure --help'
at the top level gives an exhaustive list of all global options and a
few important module-specific ones, whereas, e.g.,
   'texk/lcdf-typetools/configure --help'
also displays the 'lcdf-typetools' specific options, which are not shown
at the top level.

   The help text also mentions several influential environment
variables, but for TeX Live it is better to specify them as assignments
on the command line.

   The './Build' script used to make the binaries shipped with TeX Live
invokes the top-level 'configure' with a few additional options (*note
Building::).  The defaults discussed below are those for the actual
'configure' script; invoking 'configure' via './Build' yields different
results.

   Defaults for most options are set at the top level and propagated
explicitly to all subdirectories.  Options specified on the command line
are checked for consistency but never modified.

7.1 Global configure options
============================

Here are the global configure options.

* Menu:

* --disable-native-texlive-build::
* --prefix --bindir ...::
* --disable-largefile::
* --disable-missing::
* --enable-compiler-warnings=LEVEL::
* --enable-cxx-runtime-hack::

File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --disable-native-texlive-build,  Next: --prefix --bindir ...,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.1 '--disable-native-texlive-build'
--------------------------------------

If enabled (the default), build for a TL binary distribution as shipped
by the TeX user groups.  This requires GNU 'make' and implies
'--enable-multiplatform' and '--enable-cxx-runtime-hack' (unless they
are explicitly disabled), and enforces '--disable-shared'.

   If building TL for a GNU/Linux or other distribution, this should be
disabled and system versions of most libraries should be used (*note
Distro builds::).

   A related option, '--enable-texlive-build', is automatically passed
to all subdirectories (and cannot be disabled).  Subdirectories that can
also be built independently from the TL tree (such as 'utils/xindy' and
'texk/dvipng') but cooperate with TL can use this option to enable
TL-specific adaptations, such as installation paths.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --prefix --bindir ...,  Next: --disable-largefile,  Prev: --disable-native-texlive-build,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.2 '--prefix', '--bindir', ...
---------------------------------

These standard Autoconf options specify various installation directories
as usual.  For the complete list, *note Installation directories::.

   Also as usual, all values are prefixed by the value of 'DESTDIR', if
set, on the 'make' command line (*note Installation in a temporary
location: (automake)Staged Installs.).


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --disable-largefile,  Next: --disable-missing,  Prev: --prefix --bindir ...,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.3 '--disable-largefile'
---------------------------

Omit large file support (LFS), which is needed on most 32-bit Unix
systems for files with 2GB or more.  Regardless of this option, the size
of 'DVI' and 'GF' files must always be <2GB, due to the file format
specifications.

   With LFS, there is no fixed limit on the size of PDF files created by
'pdftex' or PostScript files created by 'dvips'.  The size of PDF images
included by 'pdftex' or 'luatex' must, however, be <2GB when using
'poppler' version 0.22 or before (even on 64-bit systems with LFS).


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --disable-missing,  Next: --enable-compiler-warnings=LEVEL,  Prev: --disable-largefile,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.4 '--disable-missing'
-------------------------

Immediately terminate the build process if a requested program or
feature must be disabled, e.g., due to missing libraries.  This can help
when figuring out a specific (sub)set of modules to enable.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --enable-compiler-warnings=LEVEL,  Next: --enable-cxx-runtime-hack,  Prev: --disable-missing,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.5 '--enable-compiler-warnings='LEVEL
----------------------------------------

Enable various levels of compiler warnings for C, C++, and/or
Objective C: the LEVEL value can be one of: 'no min yes max all'.  The
default is 'yes' in 'maintainer-mode' (see below) and 'min' otherwise.
This option defines the variables 'WARNING_[OBJ]C[XX]FLAGS', but these
variables are not consistently used in all library and program modules.
At present, these warning flags assume options from the GNU compilers.

7.1.6 '--enable-cxx-runtime-hack'
---------------------------------

If enabled (as it is for the native TL build), when using 'g++', try to
statically link with 'libstdc++', thus improving portability of the
resulting binary.  *Note Macros for compilers::.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --enable-maintainer-mode,  Next: --enable-multiplatform,  Prev: --enable-cxx-runtime-hack,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.7 '--enable-maintainer-mode'
--------------------------------

Enable 'make' rules and dependencies not useful (and sometimes
confusing) to the casual user.  This requires current versions of the
GNU build tools (*note Build system tools::), as it automatically
rebuilds infrastructure files as needed.  *Note 'missing' and
'AM_MAINTAINER_MODE': (automake)maintainer-mode.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --enable-multiplatform,  Next: --enable-shared,  Prev: --enable-maintainer-mode,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.8 '--enable-multiplatform'
------------------------------

If enabled (as it is for the native TL build) and '--bindir=DIR' or
'--libdir=DIR' are not specified, install executables and libraries in
per-platform subdirectories of 'EPREFIX/bin' and 'EPREFIX/lib' where
EPREFIX is the value given or implied for 'exec_prefix'.  In any case,
the values for 'bindir' and 'libdir' are automatically propagated to all
subdirectories.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --enable-shared,  Next: --enable-silent-rules,  Prev: --enable-multiplatform,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.9 '--enable-shared'
-----------------------

Build shared versions of the TeX-specific libraries such as
'libkpathsea'.  This is not allowed for a native TL build (i.e.,
'--disable-native-texlive-build' must also be specified).


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --enable-silent-rules,  Next: --without-ln-s,  Prev: --enable-shared,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.10 '--enable-silent-rules'
------------------------------

Enable the use of less verbose build rules.  When using GNU 'make' (or
any 'make' implementation supporting nested variable expansions), you
can specify 'V=1' on the 'make' command line to get more verbosity, or
'V=0' to get less, regardless of this option.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --without-ln-s,  Next: --without-x,  Prev: --enable-silent-rules,  Up: Global configure options

7.1.11 '--without-ln-s'
-----------------------

Required when using a system without a working 'ln -s' to build binaries
for a Unix-like system.  However, 'make install' will not create
anything useful, and might fail.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: --without-x,  Prev: --without-ln-s,  Up: Global configure options

7.2.2 '--disable-all-pkgs'
--------------------------

Do not build any program modules by default--only those explicitly
enabled.  This is useful when one wants to work on only a single
program, which is specified with an additional '--enable' option, e.g.,
'--enable-dvipdfm-x'.  It's still simplest to check out and configure
the whole source tree, but at least only the program you are interested
in, and its dependencies, are built.  *Note Build one package::.

   Without this option, all modules are built except those that are
explicitly disabled or specify 'disable' in their 'ac/withenable.ac'
fragment.

7.2.3 Configure options for 'texk/web2c'
----------------------------------------

'--with-banner-add=STR'
Add 'STR' to the default version string (which is ''TeX Live YEAR'' or
''Web2C YEAR'') appended to banner lines.  This is ignored for a native
TL build, but distro builds should specify, e.g., '/SOMEDISTRO'.

'--with-editor=CMD'
Specify the command 'CMD' to invoke from the 'e' option of TeX and
friends, replacing the default 'vi +%d '%s'' for Unix or 'texworks
--position=%d "%s"' for Windows.

'--with-fontconfig-includes=DIR', '--with-fontconfig-libdir=DIR'
Building XeTeX on non-Mac systems requires the 'fontconfig' library
headers and code.  If one or both of these options are given, the
required flags are derived from them; otherwise, they are determined via
'pkg-config' (if present).

'--with-mf-x-toolkit'
Use the X toolkit ('libXt') for Metafont (the default is to use the
lowest-level 'Xlib' support; it seems this has the best chance of
working across X installations nowadays).

'--disable-dump-share'
Make the 'fmt'/'base' dump files architecture dependent (somewhat faster
on LittleEndian architectures).

'--disable-ipc'
Disable TeX's '--ipc' option.

'--disable-mf-nowin'
Do not build a separate non-graphically-capable Metafont ('mf-nowin').

'--disable-tex', '--enable-etex', ...
Do not or do build the various TeX, Metafont, and MetaPost engines
(defaults are defined in the fragment 'texk/web2c/ac/web2c.ac').

'--disable-web-progs'
Do not build the original WEB programs 'bibtex', ..., 'weave'.  Useful
if, e.g., you only want to (re)build some engines.

'--enable-auto-core'
This option causes TeX and Metafont to produce a core dump when a
particular hacky filename is encountered, for use in creating preloaded
binaries.  This is rarely done nowadays.

'--enable-libtool-hack'
If enabled (which is the default for all platforms), prevents 'libtool'
from linking explicitly with dependencies of 'libfontconfig' such as
'libexpat'.

'--enable-*win'
Include various types of non-X window support for Metafont (EPSF output,
'mftalk', old graphics terminals, ...).

'--enable-tex-synctex', '--disable-etex-synctex', ...
Build the TeX engines with or without 'SyncTeX' support; ignored for a
native TeX Live build.  Defaults are defined in
'texk/web2c/ac/web2c.ac'.

'--disable-synctex'
Do not build the 'SyncTeX' library and tool.

-------------------------------------------

The programs 'bibtex8' and 'bibtexu' have been merged into the module
'bibtex-x' (extended BibTeX).

'--disable-bibtex8'
Do not build the 'bibtex8' program.

'--disable-bibtexu'
Do not build the 'bibtexu' program (building 'bibtexu' requires 'ICU'
libraries).

--------------------------------------------

The former modules 'dvipdfmx' (extended DVI to PDF converter) and
'xdvipdfmx' (the same, as used by XeTeX) have been merged into
'dvipdfm-x' at the source level.  Two separate binaries are still
created by default.  In addition, 'dvipdfm' is created as a symlink to
'dvipdfmx', with backward-compatible (very slightly different) behavior.

'--disable-dvipdfmx'
Do not build the 'dvipdfmx' program or make the 'dvipdfm' symlink.

'--disable-xdvipdfmx'
Do not build the 'xdvipdfmx' program.

7.2.6 Configure options for 'texk/dvisvgm'
------------------------------------------

'--with-system-libgs'
Build 'dvisvgm' using installed Ghostscript ('gs') headers and library
(not allowed for a native TL build).  The default is to load the 'gs'
library at runtime if possible, else to disable support for PostScript
specials.

'--without-libgs'
Build 'dvisvgm' without PostScript support at all.  Because the dynamic
loading just mentioned defeats all attempts at static linking, the
result can crash due to library incompatibilities, e.g., on CentOS 5.

'--with-libgs-includes=DIR', '--with-libgs-libdir=DIR'
Specify non-standard locations of the Ghostscript headers and library.

Hardwire the location of Ghostscript ('gs') as called by Xdvik.

'--with-xdvi-x-toolkit=KIT'
Use toolkit 'KIT' for 'xdvik', one of: 'motif xaw xaw3d neXtaw'.  The
default is 'motif' if available, else 'xaw'.

'--enable-xi2-scrolling'
Use XInput 2.1 "smooth scrolling" if available (default: yes, except for
a native TL build).

Build and install 'xindy' rules (default: yes, except for a native TL
build).

'--enable-xindy-docs'
Build and install 'xindy' documentation (default: yes, except for a
native TL build).

'--with-clisp-runtime=FILENAME'
Specifies the full path for the Clisp runtime file ('lisp.run' or
'lisp.exe') to be installed.  When specified as 'default' (the default
for a native TL build) the path is determined by the Clisp executable;
the value 'system' (not allowed for a native TL build, but the default
otherwise) indicates that 'xindy' will use the installed version of
'clisp' (which must be identical to the one used to build 'xindy').

7.3 Library-specific configure options
======================================

Here are (some of) the library-specific 'configure' options, starting
with this generic one:

'--with-system-LIB'

   Use an installed (system) version of the library 'LIB'; this option
exists for most libraries, but is not allowed for a native TL build.
Using a system version implies also using the system versions of all
libraries that LIB depends on.

   For many libraries '--with-LIB-includes=DIR' and
'--with-LIB-libdir=DIR' can specify non-standard search locations;
others use 'pkg-config' or similar to determine the required flags.

   The top-level 'configure' script performs a consistency check for all
required system libraries and bails out if tests fail.

* Menu:

* Configure options for kpathsea::
* Configure options for system poppler::


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Configure options for kpathsea,  Next: Configure options for system poppler,  Up: Library-specific configure options

7.3.1 Configure options for 'kpathsea'
--------------------------------------

'--enable-CMD-default', '--disable-CMD-default'
Determine the compile time default for whether or not to run CMD, which
is one of:
'mkocp'
     (Omega compiled translation process file)
'mkofm'
     (Omega font metrics file)
'mktexfmt'
     (format/base dump file)
'mktexmf'
     (Metafont source)
'mktexpk'
     (PK bitmap font)
'mktextex'
     (TeX source)
'mktextfm'
     (TFM file)

to generate the specified type of file dynamically.  The default can be
overridden by the user in any case (*note kpathsea library::).


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Configure options for system poppler,  Prev: Configure options for kpathsea,  Up: Library-specific configure options

7.3.2 Configure options for system 'poppler'
--------------------------------------------

Building XeTeX requires 'poppler', either from the TL tree or system
headers and library.  Building pdfTeX requires either 'xpdf' from the
TeX Live tree or system 'poppler' headers and library.

'--with-system-poppler'
Use a system version (0.18 or newer) of 'poppler' for LuaTeX (or
LuaJITTeX) and XeTeX, and use 'pkg-config' to obtain the required flags.

'--with-system-xpdf'
Use a system version (0.12 or newer) of 'poppler' (and 'pkg-config') for
pdfTeX instead of 'xpdf' from the TL tree.  *Note --disable-largefile::.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Variables for configure,  Prev: Library-specific configure options,  Up: Configure options

7.4 Variables for configure
===========================

The values for these variables can be specified as 'configure' arguments
of the form 'VAR=VALUE'.  They can also be defined in the environment,
but that might not work for cross compilations.

'CC'
'CXX'
'CPPFLAGS'
     And plenty more.  As usual with Autoconf, these variables specify
     the name (or full path) of compilers, preprocessor flags, and
     similar.  *Note (autoconf)Preset Output Variables::.

'CLISP'
     Name (or full path) of the 'clisp' executable, used to build
     'xindy'.

'FT2_CONFIG'
'ICU_CONFIG'
'PKG_CONFIG'
     These specify the name (or path) for the 'freetype-config',
     'icu-config', and 'pkg-config' commands used to determine the flags
     required for system versions of 'libfreetype', the ICU libraries,
     and other libraries, respectively.

'KPSEWHICH'
     Name (or path) of an installed 'kpsewhich' binary, used by 'make
     check' to determine the location of, e.g., 'cmbx10.tfm'.

'MAKE'
'SED'
     And more.  Name (or path) of the 'make', 'sed', and similar
     programs; used at the top level and propagated to all
     subdirectories.

'PERL'
'LATEX'
'PDFLATEX'
     Name (or full path) for the 'perl', 'latex', and 'pdflatex'
     commands used, e.g., to build the 'xindy' documentation.

********************

Ideally, building all of TeX Live with '--enable-compiler-warnings=max'
should produce no (GCC) compiler warnings at all.  In spite of
considerable efforts into that direction we are still far from that goal
and there are reasons that we may never fully reach it.  Below are some
rules about declarations of functions or variables and the use of
'const'.  These rules should be applied to the code maintained in the
TeX Live tree and for other packages whose maintainers are willing to
accept patches.

8.1 Declarations and definitions
================================

C standards
...........

The TeX Live build system no longer supports pre-ANSI C compilers.  Thus
all function prototypes and definitions must conform to the ANSI C
standard (including 'void' in the declaration of C functions with no
parameters).  On the other hand, TL is built for a wide variety of
systems, not all of which support the C99 standard.  Therefore using C99
features should be avoided if that can easily be done.  In particular, C
code must not contain declarations after statements or C++-style
comments.

   If some C99 (or later) constructs must be used, the module should
verify that they are available and otherwise provide an alternative.
For example, the module 'texk/chktex' uses the C99 function 'stpcpy()'
that may or may not be available on a particular system.  It uses
'AC_CHECK_DECLS([stpcpy])' in 'configure.ac' to test this, and provides
a perhaps less efficient alternative (in the file 'Utility.h'):

     #if !(defined HAVE_DECL_STPCPY && HAVE_DECL_STPCPY)
     static inline char *stpcpy(char *dest, const char *src)
     {
       return strcpy(dest, src) + strlen(src);
     }
     #endif

Static functions
................

Functions used in only one file should be declared 'static'; they
require no prototype except in forward declarations.

Extern functions
................

Functions not declared 'static', usually because they are used in
several files, require an ('extern') prototype in exactly one header
file, which is included in the file defining the function and in all
files using that function--this is the only way to guarantee consistency
between definition and use.  There should be no 'extern' declarations
sprinkled throughout the C code (with or without comments as to where
that function is defined).

Variable declarations
.....................

The declaration of global variables follows analogous rules: they are
either declared 'static' if used in only one file or declared 'extern'
in exactly one header and instantiated in exactly one file.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Const,  Prev: Declarations and definitions,  Up: Coding conventions

8.2 Const
=========

The 'const' feature of C is valuable, but easy to mis-use.

Function parameters
...................

Ideally, a function parameter not modified by the function should be
declared as 'const'.  This is important in particular for strings
('char*') because the actual arguments are often string literals.  It is
perfectly legitimate and safe to use a type 'char*' value for a type
'const char*' variable (in an assignment, as initializer, as function
argument, or as return value).  It is equally safe to use a type
'char**' value for a type 'const char*const*' variable, but not for a
type 'const char**' variable since that might cause modification of a
quantity supposed to be constant.

   Getting all 'const' qualifiers right can get quite involved but can
almost always be done.  There are only a couple notable exceptions: the
X11 headers are full of declarations that ought to use 'const' but do
not; at one time, 'libfreetype' also did not fully specify 'const', but
this has not been checked recently.

What must be avoided with 'const'
.................................

The GCC compiler warnings "assignment discards qualifiers..." and
analogous warnings for "initialization", "passing arg", or "return" must
be strenuously avoided in our own code.  The only exception is when they
are caused by X11 declarations or other third party code.

What should be avoided with 'const'
...................................

A type cast, e.g., from 'const char*' to 'char*' does not solve any
problems; depending on warning options, it may only hide them.
Therefore such casts should be avoided whenever possible and otherwise
must be carefully analyzed to make sure that they cannot cause the
modification of quantities supposed to be constant.

9 Continuous integration
************************

The TeX Live sources are subjected to continuous integration testing on
Travis-CI (<https://travis-ci.org/TeX-Live/texlive-source>) via a
git-svn mirror of the sources that is pushed to Github
(<https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source>).  The git-svn mirror is
updated (currently) at 30 minute intervals, and only the last commit
pushed is tested on Travis-CI.

* Menu:

* Transfer from Subversion to Github::
* Automatic update of the Git mirror::
* CI testing on Travis-CI::


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Transfer from Subversion to Github,  Next: Automatic update of the Git mirror,  Up: Continuous integration

9.1 Transfer from Subversion to Github
======================================

The git-svn program (<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn>) is used to
check out the subtree 'Build/source' of the canonical Subversion
repository.  The author index file used is not maintained in either Git
or Subversion but can be provided on request.

   The initial checkout was done by invoking
     git svn --authors-file usermap clone \
       svn://USER@tug.org/texlive/trunk/Build/source

where the 'usermap' file maps Subversion user names to name and emails
of the authors.  Anonymous checkout is also possible:
     git svn --authors-file usermap clone \
       svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk/Build/source

   In the following, we will use _admin_ to refer to a user who has
read/write access to the TeX Live subversion repository, and is also an
administrator of the ''TeX-Live'' team at Github.  The above initial
checkout has been carried out by _admin_ on the server 'texlive.info'.

   On Github, a new git repository named 'texlive-source' was created by
_admin_ within the 'TeX-Live' "organization"
(<https://github.com/TeX-Live>).  The remote was added to the checkout
with 'git remote add origin git@github.com:TeX-Live/texlive-source.git'.

   To automate the update on Github, a new ssh key was generated and
added to the 'texlive-source' repository on Github as deployment key.
Thus, pushes using this key can only go to the 'texlive-source'
repository and not anywhere else.

   The usage of 'git-svn' requires a strict discipline to keep a linear
history in the master branch.  Since we are aiming at a pure mirror
facility on Github, we have decided to further restrict the 'master'
branch of the 'texlive-source' repository on Github to changes by
_admin_.

   This setup allows other developers to branch off 'master' and push
their branches to the Github repository, but all updates need to come
from the local 'master' (not the one on Github) to Subversion, back to
'master' on 'texlive.info', and from there to Github.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: Automatic update of the Git mirror,  Next: CI testing on Travis-CI,  Prev: Transfer from Subversion to Github,  Up: Continuous integration

9.2 Automatic update of the Git mirror
======================================

_admin_ has installed a cron job on 'texlive.info' running every 30
minute which essentially runs 'git svn rebase' and 'git push' in the
'master' branch of the checkout.  The first command fetches the changes
from the Subversion repository and updates the 'master' branch with
them, and the second pushes changes (if any) to Github.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: CI testing on Travis-CI,  Prev: Automatic update of the Git mirror,  Up: Continuous integration

9.3 CI testing on Travis-CI
===========================

The 'source' tree of TeX Live contains a top-level file '.travis.yml'
which controls the automatic testing on Travis-CI. _admin_ has
registered with Travis-CI and allowed access to the Github's 'TeX-Live'
organization's 'texlive-source' repository.  The default settings are to
build the last commit of each push.  No further action is necessary on
Travis-CI.

   If changes have been pushed via the cron job above, Travis-CI will
automatically checkout the last pushed commit and try building it.

A.3 DESCRIPTION
===============

This installer creates a runnable TeX Live installation from various
media, including over the network, from local hard disk, a DVD, etc.
The installer works across all platforms supported by TeX Live.  For
information on initially downloading the TeX Live, see
<http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html>.

   The basic idea of TeX Live installation is for you to choose one of
the top-level _schemes_, each of which is defined as a different set of
_collections_ and _packages_, where a collection is a set of packages,
and a package is what contains actual files.

   Within the installer, you can choose a scheme, and further customize
the set of collections to install, but not the set of the packages.  To
work at the package level, use 'tlmgr' (reference just below) after the
initial installation is complete.

   The default is 'scheme-full', which installs everything, and this is
highly recommended.

A.4 REFERENCES
==============

Post-installation configuration, package updates, and much more, are
handled through *tlmgr*(1), the TeX Live Manager
(<http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>).

   The most up-to-date version of this installer documentation is on the
Internet at <http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html>.

File: tlbuild.info,  Node: install-tl OPTIONS,  Next: install-tl PROFILES,  Prev: install-tl REFERENCES,  Up: install-tl

A.5 OPTIONS
===========

As usual, all options can be specified in any order, and with either a
leading '-' or '--'.  An argument value can be separated from its option
by either a space or '='.

*-gui* [[=]_module_]

     If no _module_ is given, starts the 'perltk' (see below) GUI
     installer.

     If _module_ is given loads the given installer module.  Currently
     the following modules are supported:

     'text'

          The text mode user interface (default on Unix systems).  Same
          as the '-no-gui' option.

     'wizard'

          The wizard mode user interface (default on Windows), asking
          only minimal questions before installing all of TeX Live.

     'perltk'

          The expert GUI installer, providing access to more options.
          Can also be invoked on Windows by running
          'install-tl-advanced.bat'.

     The 'perltk' and 'wizard' modules, and thus also when calling with
     bare '-gui' (with no _module_), require the Perl/Tk module
     (<http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk>); if Perl/Tk is not
     available, installation continues in text mode.

*-no-gui*

     Use the text mode installer (default except on Windows).

*-lang* _llcode_

     By default, the GUI tries to deduce your language from the
     environment (on Windows via the registry, on Unix via
     'LC_MESSAGES').  If that fails you can select a different language
     by giving this option with a language code (based on ISO 639-1).
     Currently supported (but not necessarily completely translated)
     are: English (en, default), Czech (cs), German (de), French (fr),
     Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Dutch (nl), Polish (pl), Brazilian
     Portuguese (pt_BR), Russian (ru), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl),
     Serbian (sr), Ukrainian (uk), Vietnamese (vi), simplified Chinese
     (zh_CN), and traditional Chinese (zh_TW).

*-repository* _url|path_

     Specify the package repository to be used as the source of the
     installation, either a local directory via '/path/to/directory' or
     a 'file:/' url, or a network location via a 'http://', 'https://',
     or 'ftp://' url.  (No other protocols are supported, and 'https://'
     may not work on all platforms.)

     The default is to pick a mirror automatically, using
     <http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet>; the chosen mirror
     is used for the entire download.  You can use the special argument
     'ctan' as an abbreviation for this.  See <http://ctan.org> for more
     about CTAN and its mirrors.

     If the repository is on the network, trailing '/' characters and/or
     trailing '/tlpkg' and '/archive' components are ignored.  For
     example, you could choose a particular CTAN mirror with something
     like this:

       -repository http://ctan.example.org/its/ctan/dir/systems/texlive/tlnet

     Of course a real hostname and its particular top-level CTAN
     directory have to be specified.  The list of CTAN mirrors is
     available at <http://ctan.org/mirrors>.

     If the repository is local, the installation type (compressed or
     live) is automatically determined, by checking for the presence of
     a 'archive' directory relative to the root.  Compressed is
     preferred if both are available, since it is faster.  Here's an
     example of using a local directory:

       -repository /local/TL/repository

     After installation is complete, you can use that installation as
     the repository for another installation.  If you chose to install
     less than the full scheme containing all packages, the list of
     available schemes will be adjusted accordingly.

     For backward compatibility and convenience, '--location' and
     '--repo' are accepted as aliases for this option.

*-select-repository*

     This option allows manual selection of a mirror from the current
     list of active CTAN mirrors.  This option is supported in all
     installer modes (text, wizard, perltk), and will also offer to
     install from local media if available, or from a repository
     specified on the command line (see above).  It's useful when the
     (default) automatic redirection does not choose a good host for
     you.

*-all-options*

     Normally options not relevant to the current platform are not shown
     (e.g., when running on Unix, Windows-specific options are omitted).
     Giving this command line option allows configuring such "foreign"
     settings.

*-custom-bin* _path_

     If you have built your own set of TeX Live binaries (perhaps
     because your platform was not supported by TeX Live out of the
     box), this option allows you to specify the _path_ to a directory
     where the binaries for the current system are present.  The
     installation will continue as usual, but at the end all files from
     _path_ are copied over to 'bin/custom/' under your installation
     directory and this 'bin/custom/' directory is what will be added to
     the path for the post-install actions.  To install multiple custom
     binary sets, manually rename 'custom' before doing each.

     For more information on custom binaries, see
     <http://tug.org/texlive/custom-bin.html>.  For general information
     on building TeX Live, see <http://tug.org/texlive/build.html>.

*-debug-translation*

     In GUI mode, this switch makes 'tlmgr' report any missing, or more
     likely untranslated, messages to standard error.  Helpful for
     translators to see what remains to be done.

*-force-platform* _platform_

     Instead of auto-detecting the current platform, use _platform_.
     Binaries for this platform must be present and they must actually
     be runnable, or installation will fail.  '-force-arch' is a
     synonym.

*-help*, *-help*, *-?*

     Display this help and exit.  (This help is on the web at
     <http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html>).  Sometimes the
     'perldoc' and/or 'PAGER' programs on the system have problems,
     possibly resulting in control characters being literally output.
     This can't always be detected, but you can set the 'NOPERLDOC'
     environment variable and 'perldoc' will not be used.

*-in-place*

     This is a quick-and-dirty installation option in case you already
     have an rsync or svn checkout of TeX Live.  It will use the
     checkout as-is and will just do the necessary post-install.  Be
     warned that the file 'tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb' may be rewritten, that
     removal has to be done manually, and that the only realistic way to
     maintain this installation is to redo it from time to time.  This
     option is not available via the installer interfaces.  USE AT YOUR
     OWN RISK.

*-init-from-profile* _profile_file_

     Similar to *-profile* (see *note PROFILES: install-tl PROFILES.
     below), but only initializes the installation configuration from
     _profile_file_ and then starts the interactive session.

*-logfile* _file_

     Write both all messages (informational, debugging, warnings) to
     _file_, in addition to standard output or standard error.

     If this option is not given, the installer will create a log file
     in the root of the writable installation tree, for example,
     '/usr/local/texlive/YYYY/install-tl.log' for the _YYYY_ release.

*-no-cls*

     For the text mode installer only: do not clear the screen when
     entering a new menu (for debugging purposes).

*-non-admin*

     For Windows only: configure for the current user, not for all
     users.

*-persistent-downloads*

*-no-persistent-downloads*

     For network installs, activating this option makes the installer
     try to set up a persistent connection using the 'Net::LWP' Perl
     module.  This opens only one connection between your computer and
     the server per session and reuses it, instead of initiating a new
     download for each package, which typically yields a significant
     speed-up.

     This option is turned on by default, and the installation program
     will fall back to using 'wget' if this is not possible.  To disable
     usage of LWP and persistent connections, use
     '-no-persistent-downloads'.

*-no-verify-downloads*

     By default, if a GnuPG 'gpg' binary is found in PATH, downloads are
     verified against a cryptographic signature.  This option disables
     such verification.  The full description is in the Crytographic
     Verification section of the 'tlmgr' documentation, e.g.,
     <http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#CRYPTOGRAPHIC-VERIFICATION>

*-portable*

     Install for portable use, e.g., on a USB stick.  Also selectable
     from within the perltk and text installers.

*-print-platform*

     Print the TeX Live identifier for the detected platform
     (hardware/operating system) combination to standard output, and
     exit.  '-print-arch' is a synonym.

*-profile* _profile_file_

     Load _profile_file_ and do the installation with no user
     interaction, that is, a batch (unattended) install.  See *note
     PROFILES: install-tl PROFILES. below.

*-q*

     Omit normal informational messages.

*-scheme* _scheme_

     Schemes are the highest level of package grouping in TeX Live; the
     default is to use the 'full' scheme, which includes everything.
     This option overrides that default.  You can change the scheme
     again before the actual installation with the usual menu.  The
     _scheme_ argument may optionally have a prefix 'scheme-'.  The list
     of supported scheme names depends on what your package repository
     provides; see the interactive menu list.

*-v*

     Include verbose debugging messages; repeat for maximum debugging:
     '-v -v'.  (Further repeats are accepted but ignored.)

*-version*, *-version*

     Output version information and exit.  If '-v' has also been given
     the revisions of the used modules are reported, too.

A.6 PROFILES
============

A _profile_ file contains all the values needed to perform an
installation.  After a normal installation has finished, a profile for
that exact installation is written to the file 'tlpkg/texlive.profile'.
In addition, from the text menu one can select 'P' to save the current
setup as a profile at any time.  Such a profile file can be given as the
argument to '-profile', for example to redo the exact same installation
on a different system.  Alternatively, you can use a custom profile,
most easily created by starting from a generated one and changing
values, or an empty file, which will take all the defaults.

   Within a profile file, each line consists of

   _variable_ [_value_]

   except for comment lines starting with '#'.  The possible variable
names are listed below.  Values, when present, are either '0' or '1' for
booleans, or strings (which must be specified without any quote
characters).  Leading whitespace is ignored.

   If the variable 'selected_scheme' is defined and _no_ collection
variables at all are defined, then the collections required by the
specified scheme (which might change over time) are installed, without
explicitly listing them.  This eases maintenance of profile files.  If
any collections are specified in a profile, though, then all desired
collections must be given explicitly.

   For example, a line

  selected_scheme scheme-small

   along with definitions for the installation directories (given below
under "path options") suffices to install the "small" scheme with all
default options.  The schemes are described in the 'S' menu in the text
installer, or equivalent.

   Besides 'selected_scheme', here is the list of variable names
supported in a profile:

   *collection options* (prefix 'collection-')

   Collections are specified with a variable name with the prefix
'collection-' followed by a collection name; there is no value.  For
instance, 'collection-basic'.  The collections are described in the 'C'
menu.

   Schemes and collections (and packages) are ultimately defined by the
files in the 'tlpkg/tlpsrc/' source directory.

   *path options*

   It is best to define all of these, even though they may not be used
in the installation, so as to avoid unintentionally getting a default
value that could cause problems later.

  TEXDIR
  TEXMFCONFIG
  TEXMFVAR
  TEXMFHOME
  TEXMFLOCAL
  TEXMFSYSCONFIG
  TEXMFSYSVAR

   *installer options* (prefix 'instopt_')

'instopt_adjustpath' (default 0 on Unix, 1 on Windows)

     Adjust 'PATH' environment variable.

'instopt_adjustrepo' (default 1)

     Set remote repository to a multiplexed CTAN mirror after
     installation; see '-repository' above.

'instopt_letter' (default 0)

     Set letter size paper as the default, instead of a4.

'instopt_portable' (default 0)

     Install for portable use, e.g., on a USB stick.

'instopt_write18_restricted' (default 1)

     Enable '\write18' for a restricted set of programs.

   *tlpdb options* (prefix 'tlpdbopt_')

   The definitive list is given in 'tlpkg/TeXLive/TLConfig.pm', in
'%TeXLive::TLConfig::TLPDBOptions', together with explanations.  All
items given there _except_ for 'tlpdbopt_location' can be specified.
Here is the current list:

  tlpdbopt_autobackup
  tlpdbopt_backupdir
  tlpdbopt_create_formats
  tlpdbopt_desktop_integration
  tlpdbopt_file_assocs
  tlpdbopt_generate_updmap
  tlpdbopt_install_docfiles
  tlpdbopt_install_srcfiles
  tlpdbopt_post_code
  tlpdbopt_sys_bin
  tlpdbopt_sys_info
  tlpdbopt_sys_man
  tlpdbopt_w32_multi_user

   *platform options* (prefix 'binary_')

   For each supported platform in TeX Live (directories under 'bin/'),
the variable 'binary_'_PLATFORM_ can be set.  For example:

  binary_x86_64-linux

   If no 'binary_' variable is specified, the default is whatever the
current machine is running.

   In releases before 2017, many profile variables had different names
(not documented here; see the 'install-tl' source).  They are accepted
and transformed to the names given above.  When a profile is written,
the names above are always used.

   For more details on all of the above options, consult the TeX Live
installation manual, linked from <http://tug.org/texlive/doc>.

A.7 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=========================

For ease in scripting and debugging, 'install-tl' will look for the
following environment variables.  They are not of interest for normal
user installations.

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_ENV_NOCHECK'

     Omit the check for environment variables containing the string
     'tex'.  People developing TeX-related software are likely to have
     many such variables.

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_CONTEXT_CACHE'

     Omit creating the ConTeXt cache.  This is useful for
     redistributors.

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_WELCOME'

     Omit printing the welcome message after successful installation,
     e.g., for testing.

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX'

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR'

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFCONFIG'

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFVAR'

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME'

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFLOCAL'

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSCONFIG'

'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSVAR'

     Specify the respective directories.  'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX'
     defaults to '/usr/local/texlive', while 'TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR'
     defaults to the release directory within that prefix, e.g.,
     '/usr/local/texlive/2016'.  All the defaults can be seen by running
     the installer interactively and then typing 'D' for the directory
     menu.

'NOPERLDOC'

     Don't try to run the '--help' message through 'perldoc'.

B.3 DESCRIPTION
===============

*tlmgr* manages an existing TeX Live installation, both packages and
configuration options.  For information on initially downloading and
installing TeX Live, see <http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html>.

   The most up-to-date version of this documentation (updated nightly
from the development sources) is available at
<http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>, along with procedures for updating
'tlmgr' itself and information about test versions.

   TeX Live is organized into a few top-level _schemes_, each of which
is specified as a different set of _collections_ and _packages_, where a
collection is a set of packages, and a package is what contains actual
files.  Schemes typically contain a mix of collections and packages, but
each package is included in exactly one collection, no more and no less.
A TeX Live installation can be customized and managed at any level.

   See <http://tug.org/texlive/doc> for all the TeX Live documentation
available.

B.4 EXAMPLES
============

After successfully installing TeX Live, here are a few common operations
with 'tlmgr':

'tlmgr option repository ctan'

'tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet'

     Tell 'tlmgr' to use a nearby CTAN mirror for future updates; useful
     if you installed TeX Live from the DVD image and want to have
     continuing updates.  The two commands are equivalent; 'ctan' is
     just an alias for the given url.  Caveat: 'mirror.ctan.org'
     resolves to many different hosts, and they are not perfectly
     synchronized; we recommend updating only daily (at most), and not
     more often.

'tlmgr update --list'

     Report what would be updated without actually updating anything.

'tlmgr update --all'

     Make your local TeX installation correspond to what is in the
     package repository (typically useful when updating from CTAN).

'tlmgr info' _what_

     Display detailed information about a package _what_, such as the
     installation status and description, of searches for _what_ in all
     packages.

   For all the capabilities and details of 'tlmgr', please read the
following voluminous information.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: tlmgr OPTIONS,  Next: tlmgr ACTIONS,  Prev: tlmgr EXAMPLES,  Up: tlmgr

B.5 OPTIONS
===========

The following options to 'tlmgr' are global options, not specific to any
action.  All options, whether global or action-specific, can be given
anywhere on the command line, and in any order.  The first non-option
argument will be the main action.  In all cases, '--'_option_ and
'-'_option_ are equivalent, and an '=' is optional between an option
name and its value.

*-repository* _url|path_

     Specifies the package repository from which packages should be
     installed or updated, overriding the default package repository
     found in the installation's TeX Live Package Database (a.k.a.  the
     TLPDB, defined entirely in the file 'tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb').  The
     documentation for 'install-tl' has more details about this
     (<http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html>).

     '--repository' changes the repository location only for the current
     run; to make a permanent change, use 'option repository' (see the
     *note option: tlmgr option. action).

     For backward compatibility and convenience, '--location' and
     '--repo' are accepted as aliases for this option.

*-gui* [_action_]

     'tlmgr' has a graphical interface as well as the command line
     interface.  You can give this option, '--gui', together with an
     action to be brought directly into the respective screen of the
     GUI. For example, running

       tlmgr --gui update

     starts you directly at the update screen.  If no action is given,
     the GUI will be started at the main screen.

*-gui-lang* _llcode_

     By default, the GUI tries to deduce your language from the
     environment (on Windows via the registry, on Unix via
     'LC_MESSAGES').  If that fails you can select a different language
     by giving this option with a language code (based on ISO 639-1).
     Currently supported (but not necessarily completely translated)
     are: English (en, default), Czech (cs), German (de), French (fr),
     Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Dutch (nl), Polish (pl), Brazilian
     Portuguese (pt_BR), Russian (ru), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl),
     Serbian (sr), Ukrainian (uk), Vietnamese (vi), simplified Chinese
     (zh_CN), and traditional Chinese (zh_TW).

*-debug-translation*

     In GUI mode, this switch tells 'tlmgr' to report any untranslated
     (or missing) messages to standard error.  This can help translators
     to see what remains to be done.

*-machine-readable*

     Instead of the normal output intended for human consumption, write
     (to standard output) a fixed format more suitable for machine
     parsing.  See the *note MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT: tlmgr
     MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT. section below.

*-no-execute-actions*

     Suppress the execution of the execute actions as defined in the
     tlpsrc files.  Documented only for completeness, as this is only
     useful in debugging.

*-package-logfile* _file_

     'tlmgr' logs all package actions (install, remove, update, failed
     updates, failed restores) to a separate log file, by default
     'TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/tlmgr.log'.  This option allows you to specify a
     different file for the log.

*-pause*

     This option makes 'tlmgr' wait for user input before exiting.
     Useful on Windows to avoid disappearing command windows.

*-persistent-downloads*

*-no-persistent-downloads*

     For network-based installations, this option (on by default) makes
     'tlmgr' try to set up a persistent connection (using the 'LWP' Perl
     module).  The idea is to open and reuse only one connection per
     session between your computer and the server, instead of initiating
     a new download for each package.

     If this is not possible, 'tlmgr' will fall back to using 'wget'.
     To disable these persistent connections, use
     '--no-persistent-downloads'.

*-pin-file*

     Change the pinning file location from
     'TEXMFLOCAL/tlpkg/pinning.txt' (see *note Pinning: tlmgr Pinning.
     below).  Documented only for completeness, as this is only useful
     in debugging.

*-usermode*

     Activates user mode for this run of 'tlmgr'; see *note USER MODE:
     tlmgr USER MODE. below.

*-usertree* _dir_

     Uses _dir_ for the tree in user mode; see *note USER MODE: tlmgr
     USER MODE. below.

*-verify-repo=[none|main|all]*

     Defines the level of verification done: If 'none' is specified, no
     verification whatsoever is done.  If 'main' is given and a working
     GnuPG ('gpg') binary is available, all repositories are checked,
     but only the main repository is required to be signed.  If 'all' is
     given, then all repositories need to be signed.  See *note
     CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION: tlmgr CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION. below
     for details.

   The standard options for TeX Live programs are also accepted:
'--help/-h/-?', '--version', '-q' (no informational messages), '-v'
(debugging messages, can be repeated).  For the details about these, see
the 'TeXLive::TLUtils' documentation.

   The '--version' option shows version information about the TeX Live
release and about the 'tlmgr' script itself.  If '-v' is also given,
revision number for the loaded TeX Live Perl modules are shown, too.

B.6.1 help
----------

Display this help information and exit (same as '--help', and on the web
at <http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html>).  Sometimes the 'perldoc'
and/or 'PAGER' programs on the system have problems, resulting in
control characters being literally output.  This can't always be
detected, but you can set the 'NOPERLDOC' environment variable and
'perldoc' will not be used.

B.6.2 version
-------------

Gives version information (same as '--version').

   If '-v' has been given the revisions of the used modules are
reported, too.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: tlmgr backup,  Next: tlmgr candidates _pkg_,  Prev: tlmgr version,  Up: tlmgr ACTIONS

B.6.3 backup
------------

*backup [_option_...] -all*

*backup [_option_...] _pkg_...*

     If the '--clean' option is not specified, this action makes a
     backup of the given packages, or all packages given '--all'.  These
     backups are saved to the value of the '--backupdir' option, if that
     is an existing and writable directory.  If '--backupdir' is not
     given, the 'backupdir' option setting in the TLPDB is used, if
     present.  If both are missing, no backups are made.

     If the '--clean' option is specified, backups are pruned (removed)
     instead of saved.  The optional integer value _N_ may be specified
     to set the number of backups that will be retained when cleaning.
     If 'N' is not given, the value of the 'autobackup' option is used.
     If both are missing, an error is issued.  For more details of
     backup pruning, see the 'option' action.

     Options:

     *-backupdir* _directory_

          Overrides the 'backupdir' option setting in the TLPDB. The
          _directory_ argument is required and must specify an existing,
          writable directory where backups are to be placed.

     *-all*

          If '--clean' is not specified, make a backup of all packages
          in the TeX Live installation; this will take quite a lot of
          space and time.  If '--clean' is specified, all packages are
          pruned.

     *-clean*[=_N_]

          Instead of making backups, prune the backup directory of old
          backups, as explained above.  The optional integer argument
          _N_ overrides the 'autobackup' option set in the TLPDB. You
          must use '--all' or a list of packages together with this
          option, as desired.

     *-dry-run*

          Nothing is actually backed up or removed; instead, the actions
          to be performed are written to the terminal.

B.6.5 check [_option_...] [files|depends|executes|runfiles|all]
---------------------------------------------------------------

Executes one (or all) check(s) on the consistency of the installation.

*files*

     Checks that all files listed in the local TLPDB ('texlive.tlpdb')
     are actually present, and lists those missing.

*depends*

     Lists those packages which occur as dependencies in an installed
     collection, but are themselves not installed, and those packages
     which are not contained in any collection.

     If you call 'tlmgr check collections' this test will be carried out
     instead since former versions for 'tlmgr' called it that way.

*executes*

     Check that the files referred to by 'execute' directives in the TeX
     Live Database are present.

*runfiles*

     List those filenames that are occurring more than one time in the
     runfiles sections.

   Options:

*-use-svn*

     Use the output of 'svn status' instead of listing the files; for
     checking the TL development repository.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: tlmgr conf,  Next: tlmgr dump-tlpdb [_option_...] [--json],  Prev: tlmgr check [_option_...] [files|depends|executes|runfiles|all],  Up: tlmgr ACTIONS

B.6.6 conf
----------

*conf [texmf|tlmgr|updmap [-conffile _file_] [-delete] [_key_ [_value_]]]*

*conf auxtrees [-conffile _file_] [show|add|delete] [_value_]*

     With only 'conf', show general configuration information for TeX
     Live, including active configuration files, path settings, and
     more.  This is like running 'texconfig conf', but works on all
     supported platforms.

     With one of 'conf texmf', 'conf tlmgr', or 'conf updmap', shows all
     key/value pairs (i.e., all settings) as saved in 'ROOT/texmf.cnf',
     the user-specific 'tlmgr' configuration file (see below), or the
     first found (via 'kpsewhich') 'updmap.cfg' file, respectively.

     If _key_ is given in addition, shows the value of only that _key_
     in the respective file.  If option _-delete_ is also given, the
     value in the given configuration file is entirely removed (not just
     commented out).

     If _value_ is given in addition, _key_ is set to _value_ in the
     respective file.  _No error checking is done!_

     The 'PATH' value shown by 'conf' is as used by 'tlmgr'.  The
     directory in which the 'tlmgr' executable is found is automatically
     prepended to the PATH value inherited from the environment.

     Here is a practical example of changing configuration values.  If
     the execution of (some or all) system commands via '\write18' was
     left enabled during installation, you can disable it afterwards:

       tlmgr conf texmf shell_escape 0

     The subcommand 'auxtrees' allows adding and removing arbitrary
     additional texmf trees, completely under user control.  'auxtrees
     show' shows the list of additional trees, 'auxtrees add' _tree_
     adds a tree to the list, and 'auxtrees remove' _tree_ removes a
     tree from the list (if present).  The trees should not contain an
     'ls-R' file (or files might not be found if the 'ls-R' becomes
     stale).  This works by manipulating the Kpathsea variable
     'TEXMFAUXTREES', in 'ROOT/texmf.cnf'.  Example:

       tlmgr conf auxtrees add /quick/test/tree
       tlmgr conf auxtrees remove /quick/test/tree

     In all cases the configuration file can be explicitly specified via
     the option '--conffile' _file_, if desired.

     Warning: The general facility for changing configuration values is
     here, but tinkering with settings in this way is strongly
     discouraged.  Again, no error checking on either keys or values is
     done, so any sort of breakage is possible.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: tlmgr dump-tlpdb [_option_...] [--json],  Next: tlmgr generate,  Prev: tlmgr conf,  Up: tlmgr ACTIONS

B.6.7 dump-tlpdb [_option_...] [-json]
--------------------------------------

Dump complete local or remote TLPDB to standard output, as-is.  The
output is analogous to the '--machine-readable' output; see *note
MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT: tlmgr MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT. section.

   Options:

*-local*

     Dump the local TLPDB.

*-remote*

     Dump the remote TLPDB.

*-json*

     Instead of dumping the actual content, the database is dumped as
     JSON. For the format of JSON output see
     'tlpkg/doc/JSON-formats.txt', format definition 'TLPDB'.

   Exactly one of '--local' and '--remote' must be given.

   In either case, the first line of the output specifies the repository
location, in this format:

  "location-url" "\t" location

   where 'location-url' is the literal field name, followed by a tab,
and _location_ is the file or url to the repository.

   Line endings may be either LF or CRLF depending on the current
platform.

B.6.8 generate
--------------

*generate [_option_...] language*

*generate [_option_...] language.dat*

*generate [_option_...] language.def*

*generate [_option_...] language.dat.lua*

   The 'generate' action overwrites any manual changes made in the
respective files: it recreates them from scratch based on the
information of the installed packages, plus local adaptions.  The TeX
Live installer and 'tlmgr' routinely call 'generate' for all of these
files.

   For managing your own fonts, please read the 'updmap --help'
information and/or <http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html>.

   For managing your own formats, please read the 'fmtutil --help'
information.

   In more detail: 'generate' remakes any of the configuration files
'language.dat', 'language.def', and 'language.dat.lua' from the
information present in the local TLPDB, plus locally-maintained files.

   The locally-maintained files are 'language-local.dat',
'language-local.def', or 'language-local.dat.lua', searched for in
'TEXMFLOCAL' in the respective directories.  If local additions are
present, the final file is made by starting with the main file, omitting
any entries that the local file specifies to be disabled, and finally
appending the local file.

   (Historical note: The formerly supported 'updmap-local.cfg' and
'fmtutil-local.cnf' are no longer read, since 'updmap' and 'fmtutil' now
reads and supports multiple configuration files.  Thus, local additions
can and should be put into an 'updmap.cfg' of 'fmtutil.cnf' file in
'TEXMFLOCAL'.  The 'generate updmap' and 'generate fmtutil' actions no
longer exist.)

   Local files specify entries to be disabled with a comment line,
namely one of these:

  %!NAME
  --!NAME

   where 'language.dat' and 'language.def' use '%', and
'language.dat.lua' use '--'.  In all cases, the _name_ is the respective
format name or hyphenation pattern identifier.  Examples:

  %!german
  --!usenglishmax

   (Of course, you're not likely to actually want to disable those
particular items.  They're just examples.)

   After such a disabling line, the local file can include another entry
for the same item, if a different definition is desired.  In general,
except for the special disabling lines, the local files follow the same
syntax as the master files.

   The form 'generate language' recreates all three files
'language.dat', 'language.def', and 'language.dat.lua', while the forms
with an extension recreates only that given language file.

   Options:

*-dest* _output_file_

     specifies the output file (defaults to the respective location in
     'TEXMFSYSVAR').  If '--dest' is given to 'generate language', it
     serves as a basename onto which '.dat' will be appended for the
     name of the 'language.dat' output file, '.def' will be appended to
     the value for the name of the 'language.def' output file, and
     '.dat.lua' to the name of the 'language.dat.lua' file.  (This is
     just to avoid overwriting; if you want a specific name for each
     output file, we recommend invoking 'tlmgr' twice.)

*-localcfg* _local_conf_file_

     specifies the (optional) local additions (defaults to the
     respective location in 'TEXMFLOCAL').

*-rebuild-sys*

     tells 'tlmgr' to run necessary programs after config files have
     been regenerated.  These are: 'fmtutil-sys --all' after 'generate
     fmtutil', 'fmtutil-sys --byhyphen .../language.dat' after 'generate
     language.dat', and 'fmtutil-sys --byhyphen .../language.def' after
     'generate language.def'.

     These subsequent calls cause the newly-generated files to actually
     take effect.  This is not done by default since those calls are
     lengthy processes and one might want to made several related
     changes in succession before invoking these programs.

   The respective locations are as follows:

  tex/generic/config/language.dat (and language-local.dat)
  tex/generic/config/language.def (and language-local.def)
  tex/generic/config/language.dat.lua (and language-local.dat.lua)

B.6.10 info
-----------

*info [_option_...] _pkg_...*

*info [_option_...] collections*

*info [_option_...] schemes*

     With no argument, lists all packages available at the package
     repository, prefixing those already installed with 'i'.

     With the single word 'collections' or 'schemes' as the argument,
     lists the request type instead of all packages.

     With any other arguments, display information about _pkg_: the
     name, category, short and long description, sizes, installation
     status, and TeX Live revision number.  If _pkg_ is not locally
     installed, searches in the remote installation source.

     For normal packages (not collections or schemes), the sizes of the
     four groups of files (run/src/doc/bin files) are shown separately.
     For collections, the cumulative size is shown, including all
     directly-dependent packages (but not dependent collections).  For
     schemes, the cumulative size is also shown, including all
     directly-dependent collections and packages.

     If _pkg_ is not found locally or remotely, the search action is
     used and lists matching packages and files.

     It also displays information taken from the TeX Catalogue, namely
     the package version, date, and license.  Consider these, especially
     the package version, as approximations only, due to timing skew of
     the updates of the different pieces.  By contrast, the 'revision'
     value comes directly from TL and is reliable.

     The former actions 'show' and 'list' are merged into this action,
     but are still supported for backward compatibility.

     Options:

     *-list*

          If the option '--list' is given with a package, the list of
          contained files is also shown, including those for
          platform-specific dependencies.  When given with schemes and
          collections, '--list' outputs their dependencies in a similar
          way.

     *-only-installed*

          If this option is given, the installation source will not be
          used; only locally installed packages, collections, or schemes
          are listed.

     *-data 'item1,item2,...'*

          If the option '--data' is given, its argument must be a comma
          separated list of field names from: 'name', 'category',
          'localrev', 'remoterev', 'shortdesc', 'longdesc', 'installed',
          'size', 'relocatable', 'depends', 'cat-version', 'cat-date',
          or 'cat-license'.  In this case the requested packages'
          information is listed in CSV format one package per line, and
          the column information is given by the 'itemN'.  The 'depends'
          column contains the name of all dependencies separated by ':'.

     *-json*

          In case '--json' is specified, the output is a JSON encoded
          array where each array element is the JSON representation of a
          single 'TLPOBJ' but with additional information.  For details
          see 'tlpkg/doc/JSON-formats.txt', format definition:
          'TLPOBJINFO'.  If both '--json' and '--data' are given,
          '--json' takes precedence.

   By default this also installs all packages on which the given _pkg_s
are dependent.  Options:

*-dry-run*

     Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be performed
     are written to the terminal.

*-file*

     Instead of fetching a package from the installation repository, use
     the package files given on the command line.  These files must be
     standard TeX Live package files (with contained tlpobj file).

*-force*

     If updates to 'tlmgr' itself (or other parts of the basic
     infrastructure) are present, 'tlmgr' will bail out and not perform
     the installation unless this option is given.  Not recommended.

*-no-depends*

     Do not install dependencies.  (By default, installing a package
     ensures that all dependencies of this package are fulfilled.)

*-no-depends-at-all*

     Normally, when you install a package which ships binary files the
     respective binary package will also be installed.  That is, for a
     package 'foo', the package 'foo.i386-linux' will also be installed
     on an 'i386-linux' system.  This option suppresses this behavior,
     and also implies '--no-depends'.  Don't use it unless you are sure
     of what you are doing.

*-reinstall*

     Reinstall a package (including dependencies for collections) even
     if it already seems to be installed (i.e, is present in the TLPDB).
     This is useful to recover from accidental removal of files in the
     hierarchy.

     When re-installing, only dependencies on normal packages are
     followed (i.e., not those of category Scheme or Collection).

*-with-doc*

*-with-src*

     While not recommended, the 'install-tl' program provides an option
     to omit installation of all documentation and/or source files.  (By
     default, everything is installed.)  After such an installation, you
     may find that you want the documentation or source files for a
     given package after all.  You can get them by using these options
     in conjunction with '--reinstall', as in (using the 'fontspec'
     package as the example):

       tlmgr install --reinstall --with-doc --with-src fontspec

B.6.13 key
----------

*key list*

*key add _file_*

*key remove _keyid_*

     The action 'key' allows listing, adding and removing additional GPG
     keys to the set of trusted keys, that is, those that are used to
     verify the TeX Live databases.

     With the 'list' argument, 'key' lists all keys.

     The 'add' argument requires another argument, either a filename or
     '-' for stdin, from which the key is added.  The key is added to
     the local keyring 'GNUPGHOME/repository-keys.gpg', which is
     normally) 'tlpkg/gpg/repository-keys.gpg'.

     The 'remove' argument requires a key id and removes the requested
     id from the local keyring.

B.6.15 option
-------------

*option [-json] [show]*

*option [-json] showall*

*option _key_ [_value_]*

   The first form, 'show', shows the global TeX Live settings currently
saved in the TLPDB with a short description and the 'key' used for
changing it in parentheses.

   The second form, 'showall', is similar, but also shows options which
can be defined but are not currently set to any value.

   Both 'show...' forms take an option '--json', which dumps the option
information in JSON format.  In this case, both forms dump the same
data.  For the format of the JSON output see
'tlpkg/doc/JSON-formats.txt', format definition 'TLOPTION'.

   In the third form, with _key_, if _value_ is not given, the setting
for _key_ is displayed.  If _value_ is present, _key_ is set to _value_.

   Possible values for _key_ are (run 'tlmgr option showall' for the
definitive list):

 repository (default package repository),
 formats    (create formats at installation time),
 postcode   (run postinst code blobs)
 docfiles   (install documentation files),
 srcfiles   (install source files),
 backupdir  (default directory for backups),
 autobackup (number of backups to keep).
 sys_bin    (directory to which executables are linked by the path action)
 sys_man    (directory to which man pages are linked by the path action)
 sys_info   (directory to which Info files are linked by the path action)
 desktop_integration (Windows-only: create Start menu shortcuts)
 fileassocs (Windows-only: change file associations)
 multiuser  (Windows-only: install for all users)

   One common use of 'option' is to permanently change the installation
to get further updates from the Internet, after originally installing
from DVD. To do this, you can run

 tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

   The 'install-tl' documentation has more information about the
possible values for 'repository'.  (For backward compatibility,
'location' can be used as a synonym for 'repository'.)

   If 'formats' is set (this is the default), then formats are
regenerated when either the engine or the format files have changed.
Disable this only when you know how and want to regenerate formats
yourself.

   The 'postcode' option controls execution of per-package
postinstallation action code.  It is set by default, and again disabling
is not likely to be of interest except to developers doing debugging.

   The 'docfiles' and 'srcfiles' options control the installation of
their respective file groups (documentation, sources; grouping is
approximate) per package.  By default both are enabled (1).  Either or
both can be disabled (set to 0) if disk space is limited or for minimal
testing installations, etc.  When disabled, the respective files are not
downloaded at all.

   The options 'autobackup' and 'backupdir' determine the defaults for
the actions 'update', 'backup' and 'restore'.  These three actions need
a directory in which to read or write the backups.  If '--backupdir' is
not specified on the command line, the 'backupdir' option value is used
(if set).

   The 'autobackup' option (de)activates automatic generation of
backups.  Its value is an integer.  If the 'autobackup' value is '-1',
no backups are removed.  If 'autobackup' is 0 or more, it specifies the
number of backups to keep.  Thus, backups are disabled if the value is
0.  In the '--clean' mode of the 'backup' action this option also
specifies the number to be kept.  The default value is 1, so that
backups are made, but only one backup is kept.

   To setup 'autobackup' to '-1' on the command line, use:

  tlmgr option -- autobackup -1

   The '--' avoids having the '-1' treated as an option.  (The '--'
stops parsing for options at the point where it appears; this is a
general feature across most Unix programs.)

   The 'sys_bin', 'sys_man', and 'sys_info' options are used on Unix
systems to control the generation of links for executables, Info files
and man pages.  See the 'path' action for details.

   The last three options affect behavior on Windows installations.  If
'desktop_integration' is set, then some packages will install items in a
sub-folder of the Start menu for 'tlmgr gui', documentation, etc.  If
'fileassocs' is set, Windows file associations are made (see also the
'postaction' action).  Finally, if 'multiuser' is set, then adaptions to
the registry and the menus are done for all users on the system instead
of only the current user.  All three options are on by default.

B.6.16 paper
------------

*paper [a4|letter]*

*[xdvi|pdftex|dvips|dvipdfmx|context|psutils] paper [_papersize_|-list]*

*paper -json*

   With no arguments ('tlmgr paper'), shows the default paper size
setting for all known programs.

   With one argument (e.g., 'tlmgr paper a4'), sets the default for all
known programs to that paper size.

   With a program given as the first argument and no paper size
specified (e.g., 'tlmgr dvips paper'), shows the default paper size for
that program.

   With a program given as the first argument and a paper size as the
last argument (e.g., 'tlmgr dvips paper a4'), set the default for that
program to that paper size.

   With a program given as the first argument and '--list' given as the
last argument (e.g., 'tlmgr dvips paper --list'), shows all valid paper
sizes for that program.  The first size shown is the default.

   If '--json' is specified without other options, the paper setup is
dumped in JSON format.  For the format of JSON output see
'tlpkg/doc/JSON-formats.txt', format definition 'TLPAPER'.

   Incidentally, this syntax of having a specific program name before
the 'paper' keyword is unusual.  It is inherited from the longstanding
'texconfig' script, which supports other configuration settings for some
programs, notably 'dvips'.  'tlmgr' does not support those extra
settings.

B.6.17 path
-----------

*path [-w32mode=user|admin] add*

*path [-w32mode=user|admin] remove*

     On Unix, merely adds or removes symlinks for binaries, man pages,
     and info pages in the system directories specified by the
     respective options (see the *note option: tlmgr option. description
     above).  Does not change any initialization files, either system or
     personal.

     On Windows, the registry part where the binary directory is added
     or removed is determined in the following way:

     If the user has admin rights, and the option '--w32mode' is not
     given, the setting _w32_multi_user_ determines the location (i.e.,
     if it is on then the system path, otherwise the user path is
     changed).

     If the user has admin rights, and the option '--w32mode' is given,
     this option determines the path to be adjusted.

     If the user does not have admin rights, and the option '--w32mode'
     is not given, and the setting _w32_multi_user_ is off, the user
     path is changed, while if the setting _w32_multi_user_ is on, a
     warning is issued that the caller does not have enough privileges.

     If the user does not have admin rights, and the option '--w32mode'
     is given, it must be 'user' and the user path will be adjusted.  If
     a user without admin rights uses the option '--w32mode admin' a
     warning is issued that the caller does not have enough privileges.

     'platform list' lists the TeX Live names of all the platforms
     (a.k.a.  architectures), ('i386-linux', ...)  available at the
     package repository.

     'platform add' _platform_...  adds the executables for each given
     platform _platform_ to the installation from the repository.

     'platform remove' _platform_...  removes the executables for each
     given platform _platform_ from the installation, but keeps the
     currently running platform in any case.

     'platform set' _platform_ switches TeX Live to always use the given
     platform instead of auto detection.

     'platform set auto' switches TeX Live to auto detection mode for
     platform.

     Platform detection is needed to select the proper 'xz', 'xzdec' and
     'wget' binaries that are shipped with TeX Live.

     'arch' is a synonym for 'platform'.

     Options:

     *-dry-run*

          Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be
          performed are written to the terminal.

B.6.20 postaction
-----------------

*postaction [_option_...] install [shortcut|fileassoc|script] [_pkg_...]*

*postaction [_option_...] remove [shortcut|fileassoc|script] [_pkg_...]*

     Carry out the postaction 'shortcut', 'fileassoc', or 'script' given
     as the second required argument in install or remove mode (which is
     the first required argument), for either the packages given on the
     command line, or for all if '--all' is given.

     Options:

     *-w32mode=[user|admin]*

          If the option '--w32mode' is given the value 'user', all
          actions will only be carried out in the user-accessible parts
          of the registry/filesystem, while the value 'admin' selects
          the system-wide parts of the registry for the file
          associations.  If you do not have enough permissions, using
          '--w32mode=admin' will not succeed.

     *-fileassocmode=[1|2]*

          '--fileassocmode' specifies the action for file associations.
          If it is set to 1 (the default), only new associations are
          added; if it is set to 2, all associations are set to the TeX
          Live programs.  (See also 'option fileassocs'.)

B.6.23 remove [_option_...] _pkg_...
------------------------------------

Remove each _pkg_ specified.  Removing a collection removes all package
dependencies (unless '--no-depends' is specified), but not any
collection dependencies of that collection.  However, when removing a
package, dependencies are never removed.  Options:

*-all*

     Uninstalls all of TeX Live, asking for confirmation unless
     '--force' is also specified.

*-backup*

*-backupdir* _directory_

     These options behave just as with the *note update: (update)tlmgr
     update [_option_...] [...]. action (q.v.), except they apply to
     making backups of packages before they are removed.  The default is
     to make such a backup, that is, to save a copy of packages before
     removal.

     The *note restore: tlmgr restore. action explains how to restore
     from a backup.

*-no-depends*

     Do not remove dependent packages.

*-no-depends-at-all*

     See above under *note install: tlmgr install [_option_...] _pkg_...
     (and beware).

*-force*

     By default, removal of a package or collection that is a dependency
     of another collection or scheme is not allowed.  With this option,
     the package will be removed unconditionally.  Use with care.

     A package that has been removed using the '--force' option because
     it is still listed in an installed collection or scheme will not be
     updated, and will be mentioned as 'forcibly removed' in the output
     of 'tlmgr update --list'.

*-dry-run*

     Nothing is actually removed; instead, the actions to be performed
     are written to the terminal.

-----------------

*repository list*

*repository list _path|tag_*

*repository add _path_ [_tag_]*

*repository remove _path|tag_*

*repository set _path_[#_tag_] [_path_[#_tag_] ...]*

     This action manages the list of repositories.  See *note
     (MULTIPLE_REPOSITORIES):: below for detailed explanations.

     The first form ('list') lists all configured repositories and the
     respective tags if set.  If a path, url, or tag is given after the
     'list' keyword, it is interpreted as source from where to
     initialize a TeX Live Database and lists the contained packages.
     This can also be an up-to-now not used repository, both locally and
     remote.  If one pass in addition '--with-platforms', for each
     package the available platforms (if any) are listed, too.

     The third form ('add') adds a repository (optionally attaching a
     tag) to the list of repositories.  The forth form ('remove')
     removes a repository, either by full path/url, or by tag.  The last
     form ('set') sets the list of repositories to the items given on
     the command line, not keeping previous settings

     In all cases, one of the repositories must be tagged as 'main';
     otherwise, all operations will fail!

B.6.25 restore
--------------

*restore [_option_...] _pkg_ [_rev_]*

*restore [_option_...] -all*

     Restore a package from a previously-made backup.

     If '--all' is given, try to restore the latest revision of all
     package backups found in the backup directory.

     Otherwise, if neither _pkg_ nor _rev_ are given, list the available
     backup revisions for all packages.  With _pkg_ given but no _rev_,
     list all available backup revisions of _pkg_.

     When listing available packages, 'tlmgr' shows the revision, and in
     parenthesis the creation time if available (in format yyyy-mm-dd
     hh:mm).

     If (and only if) both _pkg_ and a valid revision number _rev_ are
     specified, try to restore the package from the specified backup.

     Options:

     *-all*

          Try to restore the latest revision of all package backups
          found in the backup directory.  Additional non-option
          arguments (like _pkg_) are not allowed.

     *-backupdir* _directory_

          Specify the directory where the backups are to be found.  If
          not given it will be taken from the configuration setting in
          the TLPDB.

     *-dry-run*

          Nothing is actually restored; instead, the actions to be
          performed are written to the terminal.

     *-force*

          Don't ask questions.

     *-json*

          When listing backups, the option '--json' turn on JSON output.
          The format is an array of JSON objects ('name', 'rev',
          'date').  For details see 'tlpkg/doc/JSON-formats.txt', format
          definition: 'TLBACKUPS'.  If both '--json' and '--data' are
          given, '--json' takes precedence.

B.6.26 search
-------------

*search [_option_...] _what_*

*search [_option_...] -file _what_*

*search [_option_...] -all _what_*

     By default, search the names, short descriptions, and long
     descriptions of all locally installed packages for the argument
     _what_, interpreted as a (Perl) regular expression.

     Options:

     *-file*

          List all filenames containing _what_.

     *-all*

          Search everything: package names, descriptions and filenames.

     *-global*

          Search the TeX Live Database of the installation medium,
          instead of the local installation.

     *-word*

          Restrict the search of package names and descriptions (but not
          filenames) to match only full words.  For example, searching
          for 'table' with this option will not output packages
          containing the word 'tables' (unless they also contain the
          word 'table' on its own).

B.6.27 shell
------------

Starts an interactive mode, where tlmgr prompts for commands.  This can
be used directly, or for scripting.  The first line of output is
'protocol' _n_, where _n_ is an unsigned number identifying the protocol
version (currently 1).

   In general, tlmgr actions that can be given on the command line
translate to commands in this shell mode.  For example, you can say
'update --list' to see what would be updated.  The TLPDB is loaded the
first time it is needed (not at the beginning), and used for the rest of
the session.

   Besides these actions, a few commands are specific to shell mode:

protocol

     Print 'protocol _n_', the current protocol version.

help

     Print pointers to this documentation.

version

     Print tlmgr version information.

quit, end, bye, byebye, EOF

     Exit.

restart

     Restart 'tlmgr shell' with the original command line; most useful
     when developing 'tlmgr'.

load [local|remote]

     Explicitly load the local or remote, respectively, TLPDB.

save

     Save the local TLPDB, presumably after other operations have
     changed it.

get [_var_] =item set [_var_ [_val_]]

     Get the value of _var_, or set it to _val_.  Possible _var_ names:
     'debug-translation', 'machine-readable', 'no-execute-actions',
     'require-verification', 'verify-downloads', 'repository', and
     'prompt'.  All except 'repository' and 'prompt' are booleans,
     taking values 0 and 1, and behave like the corresponding command
     line option.  The 'repository' variable takes a string, and sets
     the remote repository location.  The 'prompt' variable takes a
     string, and sets the current default prompt.

     If _var_ or then _val_ is not specified, it is prompted for.

B.6.30 update [_option_...] [_pkg_...]
--------------------------------------

Updates the packages given as arguments to the latest version available
at the installation source.  Either '--all' or at least one _pkg_ name
must be specified.  Options:

*-all*

     Update all installed packages except for 'tlmgr' itself.  Thus, if
     updates to 'tlmgr' itself are present, this will simply give an
     error, unless also the option '--force' or '--self' is given.  (See
     below.)

     In addition to updating the installed packages, during the update
     of a collection the local installation is (by default) synchronized
     to the status of the collection on the server, for both additions
     and removals.

     This means that if a package has been removed on the server (and
     thus has also been removed from the respective collection), 'tlmgr'
     will remove the package in the local installation.  This is called
     "auto-remove" and is announced as such when using the option
     '--list'.  This auto-removal can be suppressed using the option
     '--no-auto-remove' (not recommended, see option description).

     Analogously, if a package has been added to a collection on the
     server that is also installed locally, it will be added to the
     local installation.  This is called "auto-install" and is announced
     as such when using the option '--list'.  This auto-installation can
     be suppressed using the option '--no-auto-install'.

     An exception to the collection dependency checks (including the
     auto-installation of packages just mentioned) are those that have
     been "forcibly removed" by you, that is, you called 'tlmgr remove
     --force' on them.  (See the 'remove' action documentation.)  To
     reinstall any such forcibly removed packages use
     '--reinstall-forcibly-removed'.

     If you want to exclude some packages from the current update run
     (e.g., due to a slow link), see the '--exclude' option below.

*-self*

     Update 'tlmgr' itself (that is, the infrastructure packages) if
     updates to it are present.  On Windows this includes updates to the
     private Perl interpreter shipped inside TeX Live.

     If this option is given together with either '--all' or a list of
     packages, then 'tlmgr' will be updated first and, if this update
     succeeds, the new version will be restarted to complete the rest of
     the updates.

     In short:

       tlmgr update --self        # update infrastructure only
       tlmgr update --self --all  # update infrastructure and all packages
       tlmgr update --force --all # update all packages but *not* infrastructure
                                  # ... this last at your own risk, not recommended!

*-dry-run*

     Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be performed
     are written to the terminal.  This is a more detailed report than
     '--list'.

*-list* [_pkg_]

     Concisely list the packages which would be updated, newly
     installed, or removed, without actually changing anything.  If
     '--all' is also given, all available updates are listed.  If
     '--self' is given, but not '--all', only updates to the critical
     packages (tlmgr, texlive infrastructure, perl on Windows, etc.)
     are listed.  If neither '--all' nor '--self' is given, and in
     addition no _pkg_ is given, then '--all' is assumed (thus, 'tlmgr
     update --list' is the same as 'tlmgr update --list --all').  If
     neither '--all' nor '--self' is given, but specific package names
     are given, those packages are checked for updates.

*-exclude* _pkg_

     Exclude _pkg_ from the update process.  If this option is given
     more than once, its arguments accumulate.

     An argument _pkg_ excludes both the package _pkg_ itself and all
     its related platform-specific packages _pkg.ARCH_. For example,

       tlmgr update --all --exclude a2ping

     will not update 'a2ping', 'a2ping.i386-linux', or any other
     'a2ping.'_ARCH_ package.

     If this option specifies a package that would otherwise be a
     candidate for auto-installation, auto-removal, or reinstallation of
     a forcibly removed package, 'tlmgr' quits with an error message.
     Excludes are not supported in these circumstances.

     This option can also be set permanently in the tlmgr config file
     with the key 'update-exclude'.

*-no-auto-remove* [_pkg_...]

     By default, 'tlmgr' tries to remove packages which have disappeared
     on the server, as described above under '--all'.  This option
     prevents such removals, either for all packages (with '--all'), or
     for just the given _pkg_ names.  This can lead to an inconsistent
     TeX installation, since packages are not infrequently renamed or
     replaced by their authors.  Therefore this is not recommend.

*-no-auto-install* [_pkg_...]

     Under normal circumstances 'tlmgr' will install packages which are
     new on the server, as described above under '--all'.  This option
     prevents any such automatic installation, either for all packages
     (with '--all'), or the given _pkg_ names.

     Furthermore, after the 'tlmgr' run using this has finished, the
     packages that would have been auto-installed _will be considered as
     forcibly removed_.  So, if 'foobar' is the only new package on the
     server, then

       tlmgr update --all --no-auto-install

     is equivalent to

       tlmgr update --all
       tlmgr remove --force foobar

*-reinstall-forcibly-removed*

     Under normal circumstances 'tlmgr' will not install packages that
     have been forcibly removed by the user; that is, removed with
     'remove --force', or whose installation was prohibited by
     '--no-auto-install' during an earlier update.

     This option makes 'tlmgr' ignore the forcible removals and
     re-install all such packages.  This can be used to completely
     synchronize an installation with the server's idea of what is
     available:

       tlmgr update --reinstall-forcibly-removed --all

*-backup*

*-backupdir* _directory_

     These two options control the creation of backups of packages
     _before_ updating; that is, backup of packages as currently
     installed.  If neither options is given, no backup will made.  If
     '--backupdir' is given and specifies a writable directory then a
     backup will be made in that location.  If only '--backup' is given,
     then a backup will be made to the directory previously set via the
     *note option: tlmgr option. action (see below).  If both are given
     then a backup will be made to the specified _directory_.

     You can also set options via the *note option: tlmgr option. action
     to automatically make backups for all packages, and/or keep only a
     certain number of backups.

     'tlmgr' always makes a temporary backup when updating packages, in
     case of download or other failure during an update.  In contrast,
     the purpose of this '--backup' option is to save a persistent
     backup in case the actual _content_ of the update causes problems,
     e.g., introduces an TeX incompatibility.

     The *note restore: tlmgr restore. action explains how to restore
     from a backup.

*-no-depends*

     If you call for updating a package normally all depending packages
     will also be checked for updates and updated if necessary.  This
     switch suppresses this behavior.

*-no-depends-at-all*

     See above under *note install: tlmgr install [_option_...] _pkg_...
     (and beware).

*-force*

     Force update of normal packages, without updating 'tlmgr' itself
     (unless the '--self' option is also given).  Not recommended.

     Also, 'update --list' is still performed regardless of this option.

   If the package on the server is older than the package already
installed (e.g., if the selected mirror is out of date), 'tlmgr' does
not downgrade.  Also, packages for uninstalled platforms are not
installed.

   'tlmgr' saves a copy of the 'texlive.tlpdb' file used for an update
with a suffix representing the repository url, as in
'tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.'_long-hash-string_.  These can be useful for
fallback information, but if you don't like them accumulating (e.g.,
'mirror.ctan.org' resolves to many different hosts, each resulting in a
possibly different hash), it's harmless to delete them.

B.7 CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR
================================

There are two configuration files for 'tlmgr': One is system-wide in
'TEXMFSYSCONFIG/tlmgr/config', and the other is user-specific in
'TEXMFCONFIG/tlmgr/config'.  The user-specific one is the default for
the 'conf tlmgr' action.  (Run 'kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFSYSCONFIG' or
'... TEXMFCONFIG ...' to see the actual directory names.)

   A few defaults corresponding to command-line options can be set in
these configuration files.  In addition, the system-wide file can
contain a directive to restrict the allowed actions.

   In these config files, empty lines and lines starting with # are
ignored.  All other lines must look like:

  key = value

   where the spaces are optional but the '=' is required.

   The allowed keys are:

'auto-remove', value 0 or 1 (default 1), same as command-line option.

'gui-expertmode', value 0 or 1 (default 1). This switches between the full GUI and a simplified GUI with only the most common settings.

'gui-lang' _llcode_, with a language code value as with the command-line option.

'no-checksums', value 0 or 1 (default 0, see below).

'persistent-downloads', value 0 or 1 (default 1), same as command-line option.

'require-verification', value 0 or 1 (default 0), same as command-line option.

'update-exclude', value: comma-separated list of packages (no space allowed). Same as the command line option '--exclude' for the action 'update'.

'verify-downloads', value 0 or 1 (default 1), same as command-line option.

   The system-wide config file can contain one additional key:

'allowed-actions' _action1_ [,_action_,...] The value is a comma-separated list of 'tlmgr' actions which are allowed to be executed when 'tlmgr' is invoked in system mode (that is, without '--usermode').

     This allows distributors to include the 'tlmgr' in their packaging,
     but allow only a restricted set of actions that do not interfere
     with their distro package manager.  For native TeX Live
     installations, it doesn't make sense to set this.

   The 'no-checksums' key needs more explanation.  By default, package
checksums computed and stored on the server (in the TLPDB) are compared
to checksums computed locally after downloading.  'no-checksums'
disables this process.

   The checksum algorithm is SHA-512.  Your system must have one of
(looked for in this order) the Perl 'Digest::SHA' module, the 'openssl'
program (<http://openssl.org>), the 'sha512sum' program (from GNU
Coreutils, <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils>), or finally the
'shasum' program (just to support old Macs).  If none of these are
available, a warning is issued and 'tlmgr' proceeds without checking
checksums.  (Incidentally, other SHA implementations, such as the pure
Perl and pure Lua modules, are much too slow to be usable in our
context.)  'no-checksums' avoids the warning.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: tlmgr CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION,  Next: tlmgr USER MODE,  Prev: tlmgr CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR,  Up: tlmgr

B.8 CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION
==============================

'tlmgr' and 'install-tl' perform cryptographic verification if possible.
If verification is performed and successful, the programs report
'(verified)' after loading the TLPDB; otherwise, they report '(not
verified)'.  But either way, by default the installation and/or updates
proceed normally.

   If a program named 'gpg' is available (that is, found in 'PATH'), by
default cryptographic signatures will be checked: we require the main
repository be signed, but not any additional repositories.  If 'gpg' is
not available, by default signatures are not checked and no verification
is carried out, but 'tlmgr' still proceeds normally.

   The behavior of the verification can be controlled by the command
line and config file option 'verify-repo' which takes one of the
following values: 'none', 'main', or 'all'.  With 'none', no
verification whatsoever is attempted.  With 'main' (the default)
verification is required only for the main repository, and only if 'gpg'
is available; though attempted for all, missing signatures of subsidiary
repositories will not result in an error.  Finally, in the case of
'all', 'gpg' must be available and all repositories need to be signed.

   In all cases, if a signature is checked and fails to verify, an error
is raised.

   Cryptographic verification requires checksum checking (described just
above) to succeed, and a working GnuPG ('gpg') program (see below for
search method).  Then, unless cryptographic verification has been
disabled, a signature file ('texlive.tlpdb.*.asc') of the checksum file
is downloaded and the signature verified.  The signature is created by
the TeX Live Distribution GPG key 0x06BAB6BC, which in turn is signed by
Karl Berry's key 0x30D155AD and Norbert Preining's key 0x6CACA448.  All
of these keys are obtainable from the standard key servers.

   Additional trusted keys can be added using the 'key' action.

B.8.1 Configuration of GnuPG invocation
---------------------------------------

The executable used for GnuPG is searched as follows: If the environment
variable 'TL_GNUPG' is set, it is tested and used; otherwise 'gpg' is
checked; finally 'gpg2' is checked.

   Further adaptation of the 'gpg' invocation can be made using the two
environment variables 'TL_GNUPGHOME', which is passed to 'gpg' as the
value for '--homedir', and 'TL_GNUPGARGS', which replaces the default
options '--no-secmem-warning --no-permission-warning'.


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: tlmgr USER MODE,  Next: tlmgr MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES,  Prev: tlmgr CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION,  Up: tlmgr

B.9 USER MODE
=============

'tlmgr' provides a restricted way, called "user mode", to manage
arbitrary texmf trees in the same way as the main installation.  For
example, this allows people without write permissions on the
installation location to update/install packages into a tree of their
own.

   'tlmgr' is switched into user mode with the command line option
'--usermode'.  It does not switch automatically, nor is there any
configuration file setting for it.  Thus, this option has to be
explicitly given every time user mode is to be activated.

   This mode of 'tlmgr' works on a user tree, by default the value of
the 'TEXMFHOME' variable.  This can be overridden with the command line
option '--usertree'.  In the following when we speak of the user tree we
mean either 'TEXMFHOME' or the one given on the command line.

   Not all actions are allowed in user mode; 'tlmgr' will warn you and
not carry out any problematic actions.  Currently not supported (and
probably will never be) is the 'platform' action.  The 'gui' action is
currently not supported, but may be in a future release.

   Some 'tlmgr' actions don't need any write permissions and thus work
the same in user mode and normal mode.  Currently these are: 'check',
'help', 'list', 'print-platform', 'print-platform-info', 'search',
'show', 'version'.

   On the other hand, most of the actions dealing with package
management do need write permissions, and thus behave differently in
user mode, as described below: 'install', 'update', 'remove', 'option',
'paper', 'generate', 'backup', 'restore', 'uninstall', 'symlinks'.

   Before using 'tlmgr' in user mode, you have to set up the user tree
with the 'init-usertree' action.  This creates _usertree_'/web2c' and
_usertree_'/tlpkg/tlpobj', and a minimal
_usertree_'/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb'.  At that point, you can tell 'tlmgr'
to do the (supported) actions by adding the '--usermode' command line
option.

   In user mode the file _usertree_'/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb' contains only
the packages that have been installed into the user tree using 'tlmgr',
plus additional options from the "virtual" package
'00texlive.installation' (similar to the main installation's
'texlive.tlpdb').

   All actions on packages in user mode can only be carried out on
packages that are known as 'relocatable'.  This excludes all packages
containing executables and a few other core packages.  Of the 2500 or so
packages currently in TeX Live the vast majority are relocatable and can
be installed into a user tree.

File: tlbuild.info,  Node: tlmgr User mode install,  Next: tlmgr User mode backup, restore, remove, update,  Up: tlmgr USER MODE

B.9.1 User mode install
-----------------------

In user mode, the 'install' action checks that the package and all
dependencies are all either relocated or already installed in the system
installation.  If this is the case, it unpacks all containers to be
installed into the user tree (to repeat, that's either 'TEXMFHOME' or
the value of '--usertree') and add the respective packages to the user
tree's 'texlive.tlpdb' (creating it if need be).

   Currently installing a collection in user mode installs all dependent
packages, but in contrast to normal mode, does _not_ install dependent
collections.  For example, in normal mode 'tlmgr install
collection-context' would install 'collection-basic' and other
collections, while in user mode, _only_ the packages mentioned in
'collection-context' are installed.

   If a package shipping map files is installed in user mode, a backup
of the user's 'updmap.cfg' in 'USERTREE/web2c/' is made, and then this
file regenerated from the list of installed packages.

B.10 MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES
==========================

The main TeX Live repository contains a vast array of packages.
Nevertheless, additional local repositories can be useful to provide
locally-installed resources, such as proprietary fonts and house styles.
Also, alternative package repositories distribute packages that cannot
or should not be included in TeX Live, for whatever reason.

   The simplest and most reliable method is to temporarily set the
installation source to any repository (with the '-repository' or 'option
repository' command line options), and perform your operations.

   When you are using multiple repositories over a sustained length of
time, however, explicitly switching between them becomes inconvenient.
Thus, it's possible to tell 'tlmgr' about additional repositories you
want to use.  The basic command is 'tlmgr repository add'.  The rest of
this section explains further.

   When using multiple repositories, one of them has to be set as the
main repository, which distributes most of the installed packages.  When
you switch from a single repository installation to a multiple
repository installation, the previous sole repository will be set as the
main repository.

   By default, even if multiple repositories are configured, packages
are _still_ _only_ installed from the main repository.  Thus, simply
adding a second repository does not actually enable installation of
anything from there.  You also have to specify which packages should be
taken from the new repository, by specifying so-called "pinning" rules,
described next.

* Menu:

* tlmgr Pinning::


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: tlmgr Pinning,  Up: tlmgr MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES

B.10.1 Pinning
--------------

When a package 'foo' is pinned to a repository, a package 'foo' in any
other repository, even if it has a higher revision number, will not be
considered an installable candidate.

   As mentioned above, by default everything is pinned to the main
repository.  Let's now go through an example of setting up a second
repository and enabling updates of a package from it.

   First, check that we have support for multiple repositories, and have
only one enabled (as is the case by default):

 $ tlmgr repository list
 List of repositories (with tags if set):
   /var/www/norbert/tlnet

   Ok.  Let's add the 'tlcontrib' repository (this is a real repository,
hosted at <http://tlcontrib.metatex.org>, maintained by Taco Hoekwater
et al.), with the tag 'tlcontrib':

 $ tlmgr repository add http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2012 tlcontrib

   Check the repository list again:

 $ tlmgr repository list
 List of repositories (with tags if set):
    http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2012 (tlcontrib)
    /var/www/norbert/tlnet (main)

   Now we specify a pinning entry to get the package 'context' from
'tlcontrib':

 $ tlmgr pinning add tlcontrib context

   Check that we can find 'context':

 $ tlmgr show context
 tlmgr: package repositories:
 ...
 package:     context
 repository:  tlcontrib/26867
 ...

   - install 'context':

 $ tlmgr install context
 tlmgr: package repositories:
 ...
 [1/1,  ??:??/??:??] install: context @tlcontrib [

   In the output here you can see that the 'context' package has been
installed from the 'tlcontrib' repository ('@tlcontrib').

   Finally, 'tlmgr pinning' also supports removing certain or all
packages from a given repository:

  $ tlmgr pinning remove tlcontrib context  # remove just context
  $ tlmgr pinning remove tlcontrib --all    # take nothing from tlcontrib

   A summary of the 'tlmgr pinning' actions is given above.

B.11 GUI FOR TLMGR
==================

The graphical user interface for 'tlmgr' requires Perl/Tk
<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=perl%2Ftk>.  For Windows the
necessary modules are shipped within TeX Live, for all other (i.e.,
Unix-based) systems Perl/Tk (as well as Perl of course) has to be
installed outside of TL. <http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk> has
a list of invocations for some distros.

   The GUI is started with the invocation 'tlmgr gui'; assuming Tk is
loadable, the graphical user interface will be shown.  The main window
contains a menu bar, the main display, and a status area where messages
normally shown on the console are displayed.

   Within the main display there are three main parts: the 'Display
configuration' area, the list of packages, and the action buttons.

   Also, at the top right the currently loaded repository is shown; this
also acts as a button and when clicked will try to load the default
repository.  To load a different repository, see the 'tlmgr' menu item.

   Finally, the status area at the bottom of the window gives additional
information about what is going on.

B.11.1.1 Display configuration area
...................................

The first part of the main display allows you to specify (filter) which
packages are shown.  By default, all are shown.  Changes here are
reflected right away.

Status

     Select whether to show all packages (the default), only those
     installed, only those _not_ installed, or only those with update
     available.

Category

     Select which categories are shown: packages, collections, and/or
     schemes.  These are briefly explained in the *note DESCRIPTION:
     tlmgr DESCRIPTION. section above.

Match

     Select packages matching for a specific pattern.  By default, this
     searches both descriptions and filenames.  You can also select a
     subset for searching.

Selection

     Select packages to those selected, those not selected, or all.
     Here, "selected" means that the checkbox in the beginning of the
     line of a package is ticked.

Display configuration buttons

     To the right there are three buttons: select all packages, select
     none (a.k.a.  deselect all), and reset all these filters to the
     defaults, i.e., show all available.

B.11.1.2 Package list area
..........................

The second are of the main display lists all installed packages.  If a
repository is loaded, those that are available but not installed are
also listed.

   Double clicking on a package line pops up an informational window
with further details: the long description, included files, etc.

   Each line of the package list consists of the following items:

a checkbox

     Used to select particular packages; some of the action buttons (see
     below) work only on the selected packages.

package name

     The name (identifier) of the package as given in the database.

local revision (and version)

     If the package is installed the TeX Live revision number for the
     installed package will be shown.  If there is a catalogue version
     given in the database for this package, it will be shown in
     parentheses.  However, the catalogue version, unlike the TL
     revision, is not guaranteed to reflect what is actually installed.

remote revision (and version)

     If a repository has been loaded the revision of the package in the
     repository (if present) is shown.  As with the local column, if a
     catalogue version is provided it will be displayed.  And also as
     with the local column, the catalogue version may be stale.

short description

     The short description of the package.

B.11.1.3 Main display action buttons
....................................

Below the list of packages are several buttons:

Update all installed

     This calls 'tlmgr update --all', i.e., tries to update all
     available packages.  Below this button is a toggle to allow
     reinstallation of previously removed packages as part of this
     action.

     The other four buttons only work on the selected packages, i.e.,
     those where the checkbox at the beginning of the package line is
     ticked.

Update

     Update only the selected packages.

Install

     Install the selected packages; acts like 'tlmgr install', i.e.,
     also installs dependencies.  Thus, installing a collection installs
     all its constituent packages.

Remove

     Removes the selected packages; acts like 'tlmgr remove', i.e., it
     will also remove dependencies of collections (but not dependencies
     of normal packages).

Backup

     Makes a backup of the selected packages; acts like 'tlmgr backup'.
     This action needs the option 'backupdir' set (see 'Options -'
     General>).

B.11.2 Menu bar
---------------

The following entries can be found in the menu bar:

'tlmgr' menu

     The items here load various repositories: the default as specified
     in the TeX Live database, the default network repository, the
     repository specified on the command line (if any), and an
     arbitrarily manually-entered one.  Also has the so-necessary 'quit'
     operation.

'Options menu'

     Provides access to several groups of options: 'Paper'
     (configuration of default paper sizes), 'Platforms' (only on Unix,
     configuration of the supported/installed platforms), 'GUI Language'
     (select language used in the GUI interface), and 'General'
     (everything else).

     Several toggles are also here.  The first is 'Expert options',
     which is set by default.  If you turn this off, the next time you
     start the GUI a simplified screen will be shown that display only
     the most important functionality.  This setting is saved in the
     configuration file of 'tlmgr'; see *note CONFIGURATION FILE FOR
     TLMGR: tlmgr CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR. for details.

     The other toggles are all off by default: for debugging output, to
     disable the automatic installation of new packages, and to disable
     the automatic removal of packages deleted from the server.  Playing
     with the choices of what is or isn't installed may lead to an
     inconsistent TeX Live installation; e.g., when a package is
     renamed.

'Actions menu'

     Provides access to several actions: update the filename database
     (aka 'ls-R', 'mktexlsr', 'texhash'), rebuild all formats
     ('fmtutil-sys --all'), update the font map database ('updmap-sys'),
     restore from a backup of a package, and use of symbolic links in
     system directories (not on Windows).

     The final action is to remove the entire TeX Live installation
     (also not on Windows).

'Help menu'

B.11.3 GUI options
------------------

Some generic Perl/Tk options can be specified with 'tlmgr gui' to
control the display:

'-background' _color_

     Set background color.

'-font "' _fontname_ _fontsize_ '"'

     Set font, e.g., 'tlmgr gui -font "helvetica 18"'.  The argument to
     '-font' must be quoted, i.e., passed as a single string.

'-foreground' _color_

     Set foreground color.

'-geometry' _geomspec_

     Set the X geometry, e.g., 'tlmgr gui -geometry 1024x512-0+0'
     creates the window of (approximately) the given size in the
     upper-right corner of the display.

'-xrm' _xresource_

     Pass the arbitrary X resource string _xresource_.

   A few other obscure options are recognized but not mentioned here.
See the Perl/Tk documentation (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Tk>) for
the complete list, and any X documentation for general information.

B.12 MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT
============================

With the '--machine-readable' option, 'tlmgr' writes to stdout in the
fixed line-oriented format described here, and the usual informational
messages for human consumption are written to stderr (normally they are
written to stdout).  The idea is that a program can get all the
information it needs by reading stdout.

   Currently this option only applies to the *note update: tlmgr update
[_option_...] [_pkg_...], *note install: tlmgr install [_option_...]
_pkg_..., and *note option: tlmgr option. actions.

* Menu:

* tlmgr Machine-readable update and install output::
* tlmgr Machine-readable option output::


File: tlbuild.info,  Node: tlmgr Machine-readable update and install output,  Next: tlmgr Machine-readable option output,  Up: tlmgr MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT

B.12.1 Machine-readable 'update' and 'install' output
-----------------------------------------------------

The output format is as follows:

  fieldname "\t" value
  ...
  "end-of-header"
  pkgname status localrev serverrev size runtime esttot
  ...
  "end-of-updates"
  other output from post actions, not in machine readable form

   The header section currently has two fields: 'location-url' (the
repository source from which updates are being drawn), and 'total-bytes'
(the total number of bytes to be downloaded).

   The _localrev_ and _serverrev_ fields for each package are the
revision numbers in the local installation and server repository,
respectively.  The _size_ field is the number of bytes to be downloaded,
i.e., the size of the compressed tar file for a network installation,
not the unpacked size.  The runtime and esttot fields are only present
for updated and auto-install packages, and contain the currently passed
time since start of installation/updates and the estimated total time.

   Line endings may be either LF or CRLF depending on the current
platform.

'location-url' _location_

     The _location_ may be a url (including 'file:///foo/bar/...'), or a
     directory name ('/foo/bar').  It is the package repository from
     which the new package information was drawn.

'total-bytes' _count_

     The _count_ is simply a decimal number, the sum of the sizes of all
     the packages that need updating or installing (which are listed
     subsequently).

   Then comes a line with only the literal string 'end-of-header'.

   Each following line until a line with literal string 'end-of-updates'
reports on one package.  The fields on each line are separated by a tab.
Here are the fields.

_pkgname_

     The TeX Live package identifier, with a possible platform suffix
     for executables.  For instance, 'pdftex' and 'pdftex.i386-linux'
     are given as two separate packages, one on each line.

_status_

     The status of the package update.  One character, as follows:

     'd'

          The package was removed on the server.

     'f'

          The package was removed in the local installation, even though
          a collection depended on it.  (E.g., the user ran 'tlmgr
          remove --force'.)

     'u'

          Normal update is needed.

     'r'

          Reversed non-update: the locally-installed version is newer
          than the version on the server.

     'a'

          Automatically-determined need for installation, the package is
          new on the server and is (most probably) part of an installed
          collection.

     'i'

          Package will be installed and isn't present in the local
          installation (action install).

     'I'

          Package is already present but will be reinstalled (action
          install).

_localrev_

     The revision number of the installed package, or '-' if it is not
     present locally.

_serverrev_

     The revision number of the package on the server, or '-' if it is
     not present on the server.

_size_

     The size in bytes of the package on the server.  The sum of all the
     package sizes is given in the 'total-bytes' header field mentioned
     above.

_runtime_

     The run time since start of installations or updates.

_esttot_

     The estimated total time.

B.12.2 Machine-readable 'option' output
---------------------------------------

The output format is as follows:

  key "\t" value

   If a value is not saved in the database the string '(not set)' is
shown.

   If you are developing a program that uses this output, and find that
changes would be helpful, do not hesitate to write the mailing list.
