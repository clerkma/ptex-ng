        * pdfopen.c:  fixed -g (goto named destination) option for AR9.
	* README:     update for V 0.86.


2014-05-22  Jim Diamond <jim.diamond@acadiau.ca>

        * pdfopen.c:  add -g (goto named destination) option.
                      NOTE: notwithstanding the man page for AR 9.5.5 on
                      Linux, I can't get -g <named-dest> to work with AR9.
                      Allow use of '--file', '-V', '-?', '--page' and
                      '--goto' options for compatibility with (various and
                      sundry versions of) ms-windows pdfopen programs.
                      For consistency, add a '--viewer' form of that option,
                      but keep the '-viewer' form for backward compatibility.
                      Redo help text for all this.
        * pdfclose.c  allow use of '--file' option for compatibility
                      with ms-windows pdfclose program.
	* pdfopen.1:  update man page accordingly.
	* README:     updates for V 0.85.

	* xpdfopen.tex: remove from distribution, since it is now redundant
	* configure.ac: update for V 0.84.
	* README:     update for V 0.84.

	* pdfopen.c:  add -h and --help options.
	  	      Reformat usage information.
		      Add support for evince.
		      Replace '-openInNewWindow' with '-openInNewInstance'
		      since AR9 claims the former is deprecated.
	* xpdfopen.h: add support for evince.
	* pdfclose.c: add support for evince.
	* configure.ac: update for V 0.81.


2010-05-03  Jim Diamond <jim.diamond@acadiau.ca>

	* pdfclose.c: make it work with all of AR{5,7,8,9} and xpdf.
	* pdfopen.c:  add ability to parse and send function-keys.
		      Add code (commented out) in an attempt to
		      support okular (see code comments).
	* sendx.c:    add code (commented out) in an attempt to
		      support okular (see code comments).
	* configure.ac: add changes suggested by Peter Breitenlohner.


2010-04-24  Jim Diamond <jim.diamond@acadiau.ca>

	* utils.[ch]: put a function to create window titles there
	* xpdfopen.h: put constants related to the titles of various
	              PDF viewers there
	* pdfclose.c: modify to use utils.c and xpdfopen.h
	* pdfopen.c:  major modifications so it works with AR7, AR8, AR9
	              xpdf and maybe AR5, and so that it might be
		      relatively straightforward to add other PDF viewers.
		      The default viewer is AR9, this can be overridden
		      by an environment variable and a command-line
		      argument.
	* sendx.c:    Reset the error status in open_channel() so that an
		      error return doesn't become permanent.
		      Fixed mask param in XSendEvent().

	* pdfopen.c: Fold in some changes submitted by
		     Peter Breitenlohner <tex-live@tug.org>
	* pdfopen.c: Fold in some changes submitted by

2010-04-11  Jim Diamond <jim.diamond@acadiau.ca>

	* pdfopen.c: Update (in a non-backward-compatible way) to

2009-08-22  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	Avoid maximal compiler warnings.
	* pdfopen.c: Use strdup'ed literal string (malloc+strcpy) to
	initialize non-constant string.
	* sendx.[ch]: Constify string args of all functions.
	Consistently use wname for window name string param.
	(close_channel): ANSI C function definition.


2009-08-19  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* Makefile.am (AM_CFLAGS), configure.ac: Enable compiler warnings.
	* pdfopen.c (usage), pdfclose.c (usage): Declare as static.

	* sendx.h (new): Declare prototypes for functions in sendx.c.
	* Makefile.am (pdfopen_SOURCES, pdfclose_SOURCES): Add sendx.h.
	* pdfopen.c, pdfclose.c, sendx.c: #include "sendx.h".

	* sendx.c (GetRootWindow): Slightly reformulate to avoid compiler
	warning (strict-aliasing rules).
