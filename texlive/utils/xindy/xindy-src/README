xindy (`fleXible INDexing sYstem') is a flexible index processor that
creates tagged index for publication system. xindy merges, sorts, and
outputs markup for raw index entries. It is highly configurable. It
supports many languages.

This is the source distribution of xindy,
Release notes are available in the file NEWS, in this directory.

The original source is available from Sourceforge, see
http://www.xindy.org/ for more information. This Web Site should
contain also the most up-to-date information about xindy. Sadly, it
hasn't. Nowadays, TeX Live and CTAN are the source of the most current
distribution; sources are available over Joachim's Github account,
https://github.com/jschrod/xindy.ctan.


INSTALLATION (Short Version)
------------
Unpack the distribution archive, a directory xindy-<version> will
be created. Usual steps follow:

    $ cd xindy-<version>
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

You need to use GNU make; e.g., on FreeBSD or on Solaris, you need to
install it and use the command gmake instead of make.

By default, installation will be done in the /usr/local/ tree.
You can change that with the configure option `--prefix'.

The long version of the installation instructions are in the file
INSTALL.

Please note: The xindy modules directory location (currently,
$prefix/lib/xindy/modules/) is bound to be changed in future
distributions. This only matters if you install additional modules
there, at future updates.


UPDATE INSTALLATION
-------------------
There is no specific update installation procedure, sorry. You need to
install xindy anew.

If you had installed xindy 2.2 RC1 (the LaTeX Companion Release)
and you had additional xindy module files installed in the system-wide
directories, you need to move them manually to the new modules tree.
That is located in $prefix/lib/xindy/modules/ ($prefix is /usr/local/
by default).


USAGE
-----
There are two main commands:
 -- texindy, for creation of indexes for LaTeX documents
 -- xindy, for generic index creation

Manuals for these commands are installed in appropriate man
directories and additionally supplied in PDF format, in the
/doc/ subdirectory of the distribution, which gets installed as
$prefix/share/doc/xindy-<version>/.

This documentation directory has more documentation. Technical reports
are on our Web Site, http://www.xindy.org/.
